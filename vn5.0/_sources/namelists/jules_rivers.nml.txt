``jules_rivers.nml``
====================

This file sets the river routing options. It contains one namelist called :nml:lst:`JULES_RIVERS`.

.. note::
   The river routing code in JULES is still in development. Users should ensure that results are as expected, and provide feedback where deficiencies are identified.


``JULES_RIVERS`` namelist members
---------------------------------

.. nml:namelist:: JULES_RIVERS

.. nml:member:: l_rivers

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for enabling river routing.

   TRUE
       Use the river routing algorithm specified by :nml:mem:`rivers_type` to route runoff along river pathways.

   FALSE
       No river routing.


.. nml:member:: rivers_type

   :type: character
   :default: rfm

   Switch to select the river routing algorithm to use for river routing.

   ``rfm``
       Use a standalone JULES implementation of the RFM kinematic wave model (see Dadson and Bell (2010), Bell et al. (2007)).

   ``trip``
       Use a standalone JULES implementation of the linear TRIP model (see Oki et al. (1999)).

.. nml:member:: rivers_timestep

   :type: integer
   :permitted: > 0
   :default: -32768

   The number of model timesteps per routing timestep.
   
   For example, :nml:mem:`rivers_timestep` = 5 means that runoff will be accumulated for 5 model timesteps before being routed on the 5th timestep.


.. warning::
   The river routing parameter values can be highly dependent on model resolution, so care is required by the user to ensure that appropriate values are selected, tested and adjusted as required.
   
   Suggested values for global and high-resolution runs are listed below, however these should be treated as a starting point.
   
   Values for some typical configurations are included in the ``jules_riversparm`` module. 


.. nml:group:: RFM parameters - used if :nml:mem:`rivers_type` = ``rfm``

   .. nml:member:: cland

      :type: real
      :default: 0.2
      :suggested: 0.2 (global), 0.4 (high-resolution)

      The land wave speed (m s\ :sup:`-1`). See Bell et al. (2007).


   .. nml:member:: criver

      :type: real
      :default: 0.62
      :suggested: 0.62 (global), 0.5 (high-resolution)

      The river wave speed (m s\ :sup:`-1`). See Bell et al. (2007).


   .. nml:member:: cbland

      :type: real
      :permitted: <= :nml:mem:`cland`
      :default: 0.1
      :suggested: 0.1 (global), 0.05 (high-resolution)
      
      The subsurface land wave speed (m s\ :sup:`-1`). See Bell et al. (2007).


   .. nml:member:: cbriver

      :type: real
      :permitted: <= :nml:mem:`criver`
      :default: 0.15
      :suggested: 0.15 (global), 0.05 (high-resolution)

      The subsurface river wave speed (m s\ :sup:`-1`). See Bell et al. (2007).


   .. nml:member:: retl

      :type: real
      :permitted: 0-1
      :default: 0.0

      The (resolution dependent) land return flow fraction. See Bell et al. (2007).
      

   .. nml:member:: retr

      :type: real
      :permitted: 0-1
      :default: 0.005
      :suggested: 0.005 (global), 0.005 (high-resolution)

      The (resolution dependent) river return flow fraction. See Bell et al. (2007).


   .. nml:member:: a_thresh

      :type: integer
      :default: 1
      :suggested: 1 (global), ~10 (high-resolution)

      The threshold drainage area (specified in number of cells) draining to a gridbox, above which the gridbox is considered to be a river point. This is resolution dependent.
      
      Remaining points are treated as land (drainage area = 0) or sea (drainage area < 0). See Bell et al. (2007).


   .. nml:member:: runoff_factor

      :type: real
      :default: 1.0

      **It is highly recommended that this is set to 1.0 (i.e. no runoff adjustment).**
 
 
.. nml:group:: TRIP parameters - used if :nml:mem:`rivers_type` = ``trip``

   .. nml:member:: rivers_speed

      :type: real
      :default: 0.4

      The effective river velocity (m s\ :sup:`-1`). See Oki et al. (1999).
   
   
   .. nml:member:: rivers_meander

      :type: real
      :default: 1.4

      The ratio of the actual to calculated river lengths in a river routing gridbox. See Oki et al. (1999).
