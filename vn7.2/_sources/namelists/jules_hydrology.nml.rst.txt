.. nml:member:: l_pdm

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for a PDM-type model of runoff production.

   PDM is the Probability Distributed Model (Moore, 1985), implemented in JULES following Clark and Gedney (2008).

   TRUE
       Use a PDM scheme.

   FALSE
       No PDM scheme.

   .. note::
       Setting :nml:mem:`JULES_HYDROLOGY::l_top` = FALSE and :nml:mem:`JULES_HYDROLOGY::l_pdm` = FALSE selects a more basic runoff production scheme. In this scheme, surface runoff comes only from infiltration excess runoff (no saturation excess runoff), and subsurface runoff comes only from free drainage from the deepest soil layer (no lateral flow from mid-layers), as described in Essery et al. (2001, HCTN 30).



.. nml:group:: Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_HYDROLOGY::l_top` = TRUE

   .. nml:member:: zw_max

      :type: real
      :default: 6.0

      The maximum allowed depth to the water table (m).

      This is the depth to the bottom of an additional layer below the :nml:mem:`JULES_SOIL::sm_levels` soil layers and hence should be set to a value greater than ``SUM(dzsoil)``.


   .. nml:member:: ti_max

      :type: real
      :default: 10.0

      The maximum possible value of the topographic index.

   .. nml:member:: ti_wetl

      :type: real
      :default: 1.5

      A calibration parameter used in the calculation of the wetland fraction.

      It is used to increment the "critical" value of the topographic index that is used to calculate the saturated fraction of the gridbox. It excludes locations with large values of the topographic index from the wetland fraction.


   .. note::
      When TOPMODEL is on (i.e. :nml:mem:`JULES_HYDROLOGY::l_top` = TRUE), JULES follows Gedney & Cox (2003, J Hydromet, eqn 14) in assuming that wetlands occur where gridcell elevation is low enough (assumed to be where topographic index is large enough) that the water table is above the land surface (topidx > :nml:mem:`ti_wetl`) but not above the land surface by enough that streamflow may be assumed to occur (topidx < :nml:mem:`ti_max`). Both :nml:mem:`ti_wetl` and :nml:mem:`ti_max` are levels calibrated from observed wetland fractions. So, if the water table is above the surface then JULES can calculate an areal fraction of total inundation (fsat) and also the areal fraction that is inundated but shallow enough to be stagnant/non-flowing (fwetl, with fwetl<=fsat), which is the 'wetland fraction'.


   .. nml:member:: nfita

      :type: integer
      :default: 20

      The number of values tried when fitting wetland and saturation fractions to water table depth in the initialisation.

      This controls the range of ``cfit`` values tried in
      ``calc_fit_fsat.F90`` where ``cfitmax = 0.15 * nfita``


   .. nml:member:: l_wetland_unfrozen

      :type: logical
      :default: F

   TRUE
      Treat the calculations of wetland and surface saturation fractions more like those of an unfrozen soil.

   FALSE
       Use standard wetland and surface saturation fraction calculations.


   .. nml:member:: l_limit_gsoil

      :type: logical
      :default: F

   TRUE
       Limit the soil conductance to the value when the top layer soil moisture is at the critical soil moisture. Below this threshold, the soil conductance follows Best et al. (2011) equation 7. 

   FALSE
       Allow the soil conductance to increase as the top layer soil moisture goes above the critical soil moisture, as in Best et al. (2011) equation 7.


.. nml:group:: Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_HYDROLOGY::l_pdm` = TRUE

   .. nml:member:: dz_pdm

      :type: real
      :default: 1.0

      The depth of soil considered by PDM (m).

      A value of ~1m can be used.


   .. nml:member:: b_pdm

      :type: real
      :default: 1.0

      PDM shape parameter / exponent of the Pareto distribution controlling spatial variability of storage capacity. Value b=0 implies a constant storage capacity at all points.

   .. nml:member:: s_pdm

      :type: real
      :permitted: 0-1
      :default: 0.0

      Minimum soil water content below which there is no surface runoff saturation excess production by PDM (fraction of maximum storage, as S0/Smax)

      Default value is 0 - i.e. surface saturation can occur for any
      value of water storage. A value of, e.g., 0.5 would indicate that
      no surface runoff is produced until the soil is 50% saturated.

   .. nml:member:: l_spdmvar

      :type: logical
      :default: F

      Use a linear function of topographic slope to calculate S0/Smax: s_pdm=MAX(0.0,1-(slope/:nml:mem:`JULES_HYDROLOGY::slope_pdm_max`)).

      The function has been tested for Great Britain catchments.

      This function will result in high S0/Smax values for flatter regions and low values for steeper regions.

      TRUE
          Use a linear function of slope to calculate S0/Smax.

      FALSE
          Use a fixed S0/Smax parameter, specified in :nml:mem:`JULES_HYDROLOGY::s_pdm`.

   .. nml:group:: Only used if :nml:mem:`l_spdmvar` = TRUE

      .. nml:member:: slope_pdm_max

         :type: real
         :default: 6.0

         The maximum topographic slope (deg) in the linear function of slope to calculate S0/Smax. Slopes above this value will result in a S0/Smax value of zero.

         A value of 6.0 has been tested for slope fields calculated from a high resolution DEM dataset (50m IHDTM for Great Britain).

	 For slopes calculated from coarser DEM datasets, a lower value might be more appropriate as fine-resolution features of the terrain are not included.
