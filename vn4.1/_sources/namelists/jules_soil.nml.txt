``jules_soil.nml``
==================


This file sets the soil options and parameters. It contains one namelist called :nml:lst:`JULES_SOIL`.



``JULES_SOIL`` namelist members
-------------------------------

.. nml:namelist:: JULES_SOIL

.. nml:member:: sm_levels

   :type: integer
   :permitted: >= 1
   :default: 4

   Number of soil layers.

   A value of 4 is often used, and the soil layer depths in the examples have been tuned using this.
   
   .. warning::
      If :nml:mem:`JULES_SURFACE_TYPES::ncpft` > 0, ``sm_levels >= 3`` is required.

   
.. nml:member:: l_vg_soil

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for van Genuchten soil hydraulic model.

   TRUE
       Use van Genuchten model.

   FALSE
       Use Brooks and Corey model [*]_.

.. nml:member:: l_dpsids_dsdz

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch to calculate vertical gradient of soil suction with the assumption of linearity only for fractional saturation (consistent with the calculation of hydraulic conductivity).
   
   
.. nml:member:: l_soil_sat_down

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for dealing with supersaturated soil layers. If a soil layer becomes supersaturated, the water in excess of saturation will be put into the layer below or above according to this switch.

   TRUE
       Any excess is put into the layer below. Any excess from the bottom
       layer becomes subsurface runoff.

   FALSE
       Any excess is put into the layer above. Any excess from the top layer becomes surface runoff. This option was used in JULES2.0.


.. nml:member:: soilhc_method

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1 or 2
   :default: 1

   Switch for soil thermal conductivity model.

   1. Use approach of Cox et al (1999), as in JULES2.0.
   2. Use approach of Johansen (1975).


.. nml:member:: cs_min

   :type: real
   :default: 1.0e-6

   Minimum allowed soil carbon (kg m\ :sup:`-2`).


.. nml:member:: zsmc

   :type: real
   :permitted: > 0
   :default: 1.0

   If a depth-averaged soil moisture diagnostic is requested, the average is calculated from the surface to this depth (m).


.. nml:member:: zst

   :type: real
   :permitted: > 0
   :default: 1.0

   If a depth-averaged soil temperature diagnostic is requested, the average is calculated from the surface to this depth (m).


.. nml:member:: confrac

   :type: real
   :permitted: 0 <= confrac <= 1
   :default: 0.3

   The fraction of the gridbox assumed to be covered by convective precipitation.


.. nml:member:: dzsoil_io

   :type: real(sm_levels)
   :default: None

   The soil layer depths (m), starting with the uppermost layer.

   Note that the soil layer depths (and hence the total soil depth) are constant across the domain.

   In all the examples, JULES uses layer depths of 0.1, 0.25, 0.65 and 2.0m, giving a total depth of 3.0m. It is recommended that this is used unless there is good reason not to.



.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [*] In the JULES2.0 User Manual this was described as the 'Clapp and Hornberger' model and the JULES code still refers to 'Clapp and Hornberger' rather than 'Brooks and Corey'. In fact there are important differences between these two hydraulic models (Toby Marthews, pers comm.). There has been confusion in the literature and in past documentation of MOSES/JULES, resulting in these differences often being ignored, but JULES uses the Brooks and Corey model. Hopefully this confusion will be removed from future releases.
