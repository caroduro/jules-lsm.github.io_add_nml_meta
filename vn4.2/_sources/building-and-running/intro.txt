Building and running JULES
==========================


Building a JULES executable requires FCM and one of the supported Fortran compilers (see :doc:`fcm`). The Fortran 90 NetCDF interface library is required to use gridded data (i.e. data for more than a single location).

To be able to automatically upgrade namelists between JULES versions or use a GUI to configure JULES runs, Rose is required.

All of this software is freely available:

* GFortran, the GNU GCC Fortran compiler - http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/fortran
* FCM - http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/collaboration/fcm
* Rose - http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/collaboration/rose
* NetCDF libraries - http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf

.. note::
   To build JULES with the ability to run multiple points in parallel, there are additional software requirements. These are discussed in more detail in :doc:`parallel`.

JULES has only been tested on Linux but, given a suitable Fortran compiler, should run on any Unix-like system with minimal changes. The recommended way to attempt to run JULES on Windows is via the Linux compatability layer `Cygwin <http://www.cygwin.com/>`_, although this is untested.
