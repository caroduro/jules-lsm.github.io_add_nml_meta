``JULES_VEGETATION`` namelist members
-------------------------------------

.. nml:namelist:: JULES_VEGETATION

.. nml:member:: l_trait_phys

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for using trait-based physiology.

   TRUE
       Vcmax is calculated based on observed leaf traits. Leaf
       nitrogen (nmass: kgN kgLeaf\ :sup:`-1`) and leaf mass (LMA:
       kgLeaf m\ :sup:`-2`) can be based on observations from the TRY
       database. Vcmax (umol CO2 m\ :sup:`-2` s\ :sup:`-1`) is based
       on linear regressions as in :ref:`Kattge et al. 2009<References>`. Two additional
       parameters are needed: vint and vsl - the intercept and slope,
       respectively, that relate the leaf nitrogen to vcmax. Sigl is
       replaced with LMA (sigl=LMA*Cmass, where Cmass is the
       kgC kgLeaf\ :sup:`-1` and is 0.4).

   FALSE
       Vcmax is calculated based on parameters nl0 (kgN kgC\ :sup:`-1`) and neff.


.. nml:member:: l_phenol

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for vegetation phenology model.

   TRUE
       Use phenology model.

   FALSE
       Do not use phenology model.


.. nml:member:: l_triffid

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for dynamic vegetation model (TRIFFID) except for competition.

   TRUE
       Use TRIFFID. In this case soil carbon is modelled using four pools
       (biomass, humus, decomposable plant material, resistant plant material).

   FALSE
       Do not use TRIFFID. A single soil carbon pool is used.


.. nml:member:: l_veg_compete

   :type: logical
   :default: T

   Switch for competing vegetation.

   Only used if :nml:mem:`l_triffid` = TRUE.

   TRUE
       TRIFFID will let the different PFTs compete against each other and modify the vegetation fractions.

   FALSE
       Vegetation fractions do not change.


.. nml:member:: l_ht_compete

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Only used if :nml:mem:`l_triffid` = TRUE.

   TRUE
      Use height-based vegetation competition (recommended).

      This allows for a generic number of PFTs. When
      :nml:mem:`l_trif_eq` = TRUE, this is implemented by
      ``lotka_eq_jls.F90``. When :nml:mem:`l_trif_eq` = FALSE, it is
      implemented in ``lotka_noeq_jls.F90`` when
      :nml:mem:`l_trif_crop` = FALSE and in
      ``lotka_noeq_subset_jls.F90`` when :nml:mem:`l_trif_crop` =
      TRUE.

   FALSE
      Use the vegetation competition described in HCTN24.

      This is hard-wired for 5 PFTs (BT, NT, C3, C4, SH, in that
      order) with co-competition for grasses and trees in
      ``lokta_jls.F90``.

.. nml:member:: l_nitrogen

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Only used if :nml:mem:`l_triffid` = TRUE.

   TRUE
      Enable Nitrogen limitation of carbon uptake. A nitrogen
      deposition field should be provided otherwise no N deposition is
      assumed.

   FALSE
      No Nitrogen limitation. Nitrogen fluxes are calculated as diagnostics only.

.. nml:member:: l_trif_eq

   :type: logical
   :default: T

   Switch for equilibrium vegetation model (i.e., an equilibrium solution of TRIFFID).

   Only used if :nml:mem:`l_triffid` = TRUE.

   TRUE
       Use equilibrium TRIFFID.

   FALSE
       Do not use equilibrium TRIFFID.


.. nml:member:: phenol_period

   :type: integer
   :permitted: >= 1
   :default: None

   Period for calls to phenology model in *days*. Only relevant if :nml:mem:`l_phenol` = TRUE.


.. nml:member:: triffid_period

   :type: integer
   :permitted: >= 1
   :default: None

   Period for calls to TRIFFID model in *days*. Only relevant if one of :nml:mem:`l_triffid` or :nml:mem:`l_trif_eq` is TRUE.


.. nml:member:: l_gleaf_fix

   :type: logical
   :default: T

   Switch for fixing a bug in the accumulation of ``g_leaf_phen_acc``.

   This bug occurs because ``veg2`` is called on TRIFFID timesteps and
   ``veg1`` is called on phenol timesteps, but ``veg1`` did not
   previously accumulate ``g_leaf_phen_acc`` in the same way as
   ``veg2``.

   TRUE
       ``veg1`` accumulates ``g_leaf_phen_acc`` between calls to
       TRIFFID. This is important if :nml:mem:`triffid_period` >
       :nml:mem:`phenol_period`.

   FALSE
       ``veg1`` does not accumulate ``g_leaf_phen_acc`` between calls to TRIFFID.


.. nml:member:: l_bvoc_emis

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch to enable calculation of BVOC emissions.

   TRUE
       BVOC emissions diagnostics will be calculated.

   FALSE
       BVOC emissions diagnostics will not be calculated.


.. nml:member:: l_o3_damage

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for ozone damage.

   TRUE
       Ozone damage is on.

       .. note:: Ozone concentration in ppb must be prescribed in :doc:`prescribed_data.nml`.

   FALSE
       No effect.

.. nml:member:: l_stem_resp_fix

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for bug fix for stem respiration to use balanced LAI to
   derive respiring stem mass. The switch is included for backwards
   compatibility with existing configurations. Future updates should
   include this change.

   TRUE
       Respiring stem mass is derived allometrically.

   FALSE
       Respiring stem mass varies with seasonal LAI.

       In the case of a Broadleaf tree in the winter (no leaves) this
       would mean stem respiration is scaled to 0.


.. nml:member:: l_scale_resp_pm

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Scale whole plant maintenance respiration by the soil moisture
   stress factor, instead of only scaling leaf respiration.

   TRUE
       Soil moisture stress reduces leaf, root, and stem maintenance respiration.

   FALSE
       Soil moisture stress only reduces leaf maintenance respiration.


.. nml:member:: fsmc_shape

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 0,1
   :default: 0

   Shape of soil moisture stress function on vegetation (fsmc).

   0. Piece-wise linear in vol. soil moisture.

   1. Piece-wise linear in soil potential. Currently only allowed when
      :nml:mem:`JULES_SOIL_PROPS::const_z` = T and
      :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_use_pft_psi` = T.

   .. note:: The option :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::fsmc_shape` = 1 is
	     still in development. Users should ensure that results
	     are as expected, and provide feedback where deficiencies
	     are identified.

.. nml:member:: l_use_pft_psi

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for parameters in the soil moisture stress on vegetation function (fsmc).

   TRUE
       Fsmc is calculated from :nml:mem:`JULES_PFTPARM::psi_close_io`
       and :nml:mem:`JULES_PFTPARM::psi_open_io`.

   FALSE
       Fsmc is calculated from ``sm_wilt`` and ``sm_crit`` in
       :nml:lst:`JULES_SOIL_PROPS` and
       :nml:mem:`JULES_PFTPARM::fsmc_p0_io`.

   .. note:: Soil respiration and surface conductance of bare soil
	     respectively will depend on ``sm_wilt`` and ``sm_crit``
	     in :nml:lst:`JULES_SOIL_PROPS`, regardless of the setting
	     of :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::fsmc_shape`.

   .. note:: The option :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_use_pft_psi` = T
	     is still in development. Users should ensure that results
	     are as expected, and provide feedback where deficiencies
	     are identified.


.. nml:member:: l_vegcan_soilfx

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for enhancement to canopy model to allow for conduction in
   the soil below the vegetative canopy, reducing coupling between the
   soil and the canopy.

   TRUE
       Allow for conduction in the soil.

   FALSE
       No effect.

.. nml:member:: l_leaf_n_resp_fix

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for bug fix for leaf nitrogen content used in the
   calculation of plant maintenance respiration. The switch is
   included for backwards compatibility with existing
   configurations. Runs with :nml:mem:`can_rad_mod` = 1, 4 or 5 are
   affected.

   TRUE
       Use correct forms for canopy-average leaf N content.

   FALSE
       No effect.

.. nml:member:: l_landuse

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for using landuse change in conjunction with TRIFFID

   Only used if :nml:mem:`l_triffid` = TRUE.

   TRUE
       Land use change is implemented within TRIFFID. Litter fluxes
       are split between soil and wood product pools. Requires
       additional prognostics covering the product pools and the
       agricultural fraction from the previous TRIFFID call.

   FALSE
       All litter fluxes enter the soil


.. nml:member:: l_recon

   :type: logical
   :default: T

   Switch for reconfiguring vegetation fractions. Also initialises
   vegetation and soil biogeochemistry at land ice points. With the
   ECOSSE soil model this switch also ensures that the initial
   condition for soil biogeochemistry is internally consistent.

   TRUE
       For soil points (land points with no ice) ensure vegetation
       fractions are at least a minimum value and reduce other
       fractions accordingly.

   FALSE
       Do not apply the minimum vegetation fractions. This is useful
       when some points are 100% lake and urban, in which case
       reconfiguration leads to a total tile fraction of greater
       than 1.


.. nml:member:: l_prescsow

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch that determines how crop sowing dates are defined. Only used
   if :nml:mem:`JULES_SURFACE_TYPES::ncpft` > 0.

   TRUE
       Sowing dates prescribed in :nml:lst:`JULES_CROP_PROPS` are used.

   FALSE
       Sowing dates are determined by the model.


.. nml:member:: l_irrig_dmd

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch controlling the implementation of irrigation demand code.

   TRUE
       Tiles are irrigated.

   FALSE
       No effect.


.. nml:member:: l_irrig_limit

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch controlling whether the amount of water used to irrigate tiles is limited.

   TRUE
       Water for irrigation is taken first from the deep soil
       (groundwater) store, and then from the river storage when the
       deep soil store is exhausted. Tiles are irrigated up to the
       critical point if the necessary water is available. This option
       requires :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_irrig_dmd` = TRUE,
       :nml:mem:`JULES_HYDROLOGY::l_top` = TRUE,
       :nml:mem:`JULES_RIVERS::l_rivers` = TRUE and
       :nml:mem:`JULES_RIVERS::i_river_vn` = ``1,3``.

       .. warning::
         The irrigation supply code in JULES is still in development,
	 and is available in this release to support beta testing
	 activities.

         Users should ensure that results are as expected, and provide
	 feedback where deficiencies are identified.

   FALSE
       Tiles will be irrigated to critical point from an unconstrained water supply.

.. nml:member:: l_trif_crop

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch controlling the treatment of agricultural PFTs. Where
   agricultural PFTs are defined by the
   :nml:mem:`JULES_TRIFFID::crop_io` parameter.

   TRUE
       In the non-agricultural area natural PFT competition is
       calculated by a call to a new version of the lotka routine and
       in each agricultural area agricultural-PFT competition is
       calculated by an additional call to the new version of the
       lotka routine. Crop and pasture areas are defined by the
       :nml:mem:`JULES_AGRIC::frac_agr` and
       :nml:mem:`JULES_AGRIC::frac_past` variables
       respectively. Additionally, to represent harvesting, a fraction
       of crop litter is added to the fast wood products pool instead
       of the soil carbon pools.

   FALSE
       Vegetation competition is calculated for natural and crop PFTs
       together, with natural PFTs excluded from the agricultural area
       that is defined by the :nml:mem:`JULES_AGRIC::frac_agr`
       variable. Agricultural PFTs can also grow in natural areas
       where they are interpreted as natural grasses.

.. nml:member:: irr_crop

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 0, 1 or 2
   :default: 0

   0. Irrigation season (i.e. season in which crops might be growing
      on the gridbox) lasts the entire year.

   1. Irrigation season is determined from driving data according to
      :ref:`Döll & Siebert (2002)<References>` method. No irrigation
      is applied outside the irrigation season.

   2. Irrigation season is determined by maximum dvi across all
      tiles. Requires :nml:mem:`JULES_SURFACE_TYPES::ncpft` > 0. No
      irrigation is applied outside the irrigation season.


.. nml:member:: can_model

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1-4
   :default: 4

   Choice of canopy model for vegetation:

   1. No distinct canopy (i.e. surface is represented as a single entity for radiative processes).
   2. Radiative canopy with no heat capacity.
   3. Radiative canopy with heat capacity. This option is deprecated, with 4 preferred.
   4. As 3 but with a representation of snow beneath the canopy. This option is preferred to 3.

   .. note::
       :nml:mem:`can_model` = 1 does not mean that there is no
	    vegetation canopy. It means that the surface is
	    represented as a single entity, rather than having
	    distinct surface and canopy levels for the purposes of
	    radiative processes.


.. nml:member:: can_rad_mod

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1, 4, 5, 6
   :default: 4

   Options for treatment of canopy radiation.

   1. A single canopy layer for which radiation absorption is
      calculated using Beer's law. Leaf-level photosynthesis is scaled
      to the canopy level using the 'big leaf' approach. Leaf
      nitrogen, photosynthetic capacity, i.e the Vcmax parameter, and
      leaf photosynthesis vary exponentially through the canopy with
      radiation.

   4. Multi-layer approach for radiation interception following the
      two-stream approach of :ref:`Sellers et
      al. (1992)<References>`. This approach takes into account leaf
      angle distribution, zenith angle, and differentiates absorption
      of direct and diffuse radiation. It has an exponential decline
      of leaf N through the canopy and includes inhibition of leaf
      respiration in the light. Canopy photosynthesis and conductance
      are calculated as the sum over all layers.

   5. This is an improvement of option 4, including:

      * Sunfleck penetration though the canopy.
      * Division of sunlit and shaded leaves within each canopy level.
      * A modified version of inhibition of leaf respiration in the light.

   6. This is an improvement of option 5, including an exponential
      decline of leaf N with canopy height proportional to LAI,
      following Beer's law.

   .. note:: :nml:mem:`can_rad_mod` = 1 and 6 are recommended.

   .. note:: When using :nml:mem:`can_rad_mod` = 4, 5 or 6 it is
	     recommended to use driving data that contains direct and
	     diffuse radiation separately rather than a constant
	     diffuse fraction.

   .. seealso:: Descriptions of option 1 can be found in
		:ref:`Jogireddy et al. (2006)<References>`, and an
		application of option 4 can be found in :ref:`Mercado
		et al. (2007)<References>`. Options 1 to 5 are
		described in :ref:`Clark et al (2011)<References>`.


.. nml:member:: ilayers

   :type: integer
   :permitted: >= 0
   :default: 10

   Number of layers for canopy radiation model. Only used for :nml:mem:`can_rad_mod` = 4, 5 or 6.

   These layers are used for the calculations of radiation interception and photosynthesis.


.. nml:member:: photo_model

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1 or 2
   :default: none

   Choice for model of leaf photosynthesis.
   
   Possible values are:

   1. | C\ :sub:`3` and C\ :sub:`4` plants use the models of Collatz et al., 1991 and 1992, respectively. These were used in the original JULES model.

   2. | C\ :sub:`3` plants use the model of Farquhar et al. (1980); C\ :sub:`4` plants use the model of Collatz et al. (1992).

   .. warning::
      The Farquhar model can only be used if :nml:mem:`can_rad_mod` = 1, 5 or 6. Code has not been written for other values of :nml:mem:`can_rad_mod`.

.. nml:member:: stomata_model

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1 or 2
   :default: 1

   Choice for model of stomatal conductance.

   Possible values are:

   1. The original JULES model, including the Jacobs closure - see
      Eqn.9 of :ref:`Best et al. (2011)<References>`.

   2. The model of :ref:`Medlyn et al. (2011)<References>` - see
      Eqn.11 of that paper, and :ref:`Medlyn et al
      (2012)<References>`. Note that as implemented the model uses a
      single parameter (g\ :sub:`1`, assuming that g\ :sub:`0` = 0).

   .. warning::

      Only the original (Jacobs) model can currently be used with the
      UM (Option 1).

.. nml:member:: l_inferno

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch that determines whether interactive fires (INFERNO) is
   used. This allows for the diagnostic of burnt area, burnt carbon
   and a variety of fire emissions.

   TRUE
       INFERNO is used to provide diagnostic fire variables

   FALSE
       INFERNO is not used.

.. nml:member:: ignition_method

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1, 2, 3
   :default: 1

   1.  INFERNO uses ubiquitous (constant) ignitions, of 1.67 fires km\
       :sup:`-2` s\ :sup:`-1` (1.5 from humans, 0.17 from lightning).

   2.  INFERNO uses prescribed lightning ignitions, either from an ancillary or the UM.
       Meanwhile humans are assumed to ignite 1.5 fires km\ :sup:`-2` s\ :sup:`-1`.

   3.  INFERNO uses prescribed ignition using Population Density and Lightning Frequency (Cloud-to-Ground).
       These must be provided as prescribed data to the JULES run.

.. nml:member:: l_trif_fire

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch that determines whether interactive fire is used. This allows for burnt area to link with dynamic
   vegetation.

   Only used if :nml:mem:`l_triffid` = TRUE.

   TRUE
       Burnt area is calculated in INFERNO and passed to TRIFFID to
       calculate vegetation dynamics. Carbon is also removed from DPM
       and RPM pools in SOILCARB.
   FALSE
       Burnt area is zero unless prescribed via an ancillary file.

.. nml:member:: l_vegdrag_pft

   :type: logical(npft)
   :default: F

   Switch for using vegetation canopy drag scheme on each PFT.

   TRUE
       Use a vegetative drag scheme. This is based on :ref:`Harman and Finnigan (2007)<References>`.

   FALSE
       Do not use vegetative drag scheme.

.. nml:member:: l_rsl_scalar

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for using a roughness sublayer correction scheme in scalar
   variables. This is based on :ref:`Harman and Finnigan
   (2008)<References>`.

   Only use if any :nml:mem:`l_vegdrag_pft` = TRUE.

   TRUE
       Use a roughness sublayer correction scheme in scalar variables.

   FALSE
       Do not use a roughness sublayer correction scheme in scalar variables.

.. nml:member:: c1_usuh

   :type: real
   :permitted: >= 0
   :default: None

   u*/U(h) at the top of dense canopy. See :ref:`Massman (1997)<References>`.

   Only use if any :nml:mem:`l_vegdrag_pft` = TRUE.

.. nml:member:: c2_usuh

   :type: real
   :permitted: >= 0
   :default: None

   u*/U(h) at substrate under canopy. See :ref:`Massman (1997)<References>`.

   Only use if any :nml:mem:`l_vegdrag_pft` = TRUE.

.. nml:member:: c3_usuh

   :type: real
   :permitted: >= 0
   :default: None

   This is used in the exponent of equation weighting dense and sparse
   vegetation to get u*/U(h) in neutral condition. See :ref:`Massman
   (1997)<References>`. The default value is taken from :ref:`Wang
   (2012)<References>`.

   Only use if any :nml:mem:`l_vegdrag_pft` = TRUE.

.. nml:member:: cd_leaf

   :type: real
   :permitted: 0:1
   :default: None

   Leaf level drag coefficient.

   Only use if any :nml:mem:`l_vegdrag_pft` = TRUE.

.. nml:member:: stanton_leaf

   :type: real
   :permitted: 0:1
   :default: None

   Leaf-level Stanton number

   Only use if :nml:mem:`l_rsl_scalar` = TRUE.

.. nml:member:: l_spec_veg_z0

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for using specified values of the vegetation roughness
   length rather than being determined by the canopy height.

   TRUE
       Vegetation roughness lengths are specified for each PFT in
       :nml:mem:`JULES_PFTPARM::z0v_io`.

       heights and parameter :nml:mem:`JULES_PFTPARM::dz0v_dh_io`.

.. nml:member:: l_limit_canhc

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for limiting the canopy heat capacity for vegetation, which
   is calculated from the canopy height.

   Using the SIMARD canopy height ancillary gives very large heat
   capacities in the Amazon, so this switch limits the areal heat
   capacity to 1.15e5 J kg\ :sup:`-1` m\ :sup:`-2`, which is the value
   calculated by the default broadleaf tree height of 19.01 m.

   TRUE
       Vegetation areal heat capacity limited.

   FALSE
       Vegetation areal heat capacity unlimited.
