               JULES is the Joint UK Land Environment Simulation model, it is a community Land Surface Model (LSM). 
               The model can be used as a standalone model.
               It is also part of the Met Office weather and climate prediction models where it is used in the couple between the land and the atmopshere as part of the Met Office Unified Model (UM).

            <div class="well">
               JULES is used in the UK and worldwide for weather, climate and science research.
               JULES is used by meteorological services, universities, institutions and centres.
              JULES produces world class science and research.
              The code is hosted on the MOSRS which works with version control to provide a repository for all to access and browse.
             Version control allows for accountablilty, traceability and reproduceabilty.
             <p>Can you think of a scenerio when you version control would be advantagous in your current job/activity? Describe it.</p>
             <p>Describe how you share work now with collegues, could this be improved? How?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="well">
                Cylc is an intellegent workflow scheduling system that was created by Hilary Oliver at NWIA New Zealand.
                The <a href="https://cylc.github.io/cylc/documentation.html">documentation</a> descibes it in more detail.
               In summary:
               "Cylc was developed for the EcoConnect Forecasting System at NIWA (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand)."
               "Environmental forecasting suites generate forecast products from a potentially large group of interdependent scientific models and associated data processing tasks."
               Cylc is now not just used for forecasting models but for scheduling tasks on computers by people all over the world.
               Monterey - US Naval Research Laboratory use it for scheduling tasks on there computer systems.
                This is growing collaboration with people around the world, at p
resent there are 17 contributors, 11 of which are not Met Office UK.
                The code is hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/cylc/cylc">cylc/cylc</a>.

                <h2>What is Rose?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="well">
                Rose is a wrapper to Cylc.
                It was developed when the Met Office saw the potential power of Cylc and that it coud be made more user friendly but adding some additional functions around Cylc in the form of Rose.
                The Met Office wanted to work with NIWA to develop both Cylc and Rose for forecasting.
                This is growing collaboration with people around the world, at present there are 17 contributors, 4 of which are not Met Office UK.
                The code is hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/metomi/rose">metomi/rose</a>.
                The <a href="http://metomi.github.io/rose/doc/rose.html">Rose documentation</a> can be useful for background reading and a more detailed explaination for how the infrastructure works.

                <h2>Why used Rose/Cylc?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="well">
                Rose/Cylc provides a user friendly interface for JULES suites and allows them to be scheduled in the most efficent way using Cylc's clever algorithum (code).
                This means you just provide the order that you would like to run things in and it does the rest for you, submitting them once the dependancies have been meet.
                Rose/Cylc provides a user friendly interface for JULES code development with tests to check that your development has not broken someone else or some other code.
                Rose suites can be shared via the MOSRS using the "u-repository" and therefore you can choise an existing suite (bunch of tasks with the dependancies, inputs, outputs, all collected in one place) or adapt and existing suite for your own needs and run it to get your data.
               You can run bash, python, R, IDL scripts/tasks all as part of the suite, which means once it is set up you can run the suite and get on with a cuppa or some other work!
               Rose can retrieve data, archive data, remove data, plot data etc if you give it the correct tasks and tell it what the dependancies are.
               Rose means that you can run many suites with slightly different setting using the same base suite one straight after the other without having to wait for the first one to finish before running the next.
               Rose is meant to make your life easier so if it not try to figure out why and make it help.
               What work/activity/research that you are doing do you think you could use Rose/Cycl for?

                <h4>Key Features of Subversion:</h4>
                <li>It is an incremental change tracking system.</li>
                <li>We can explore the changes at each change and recall a version using its 
                    revision number.
                </li>
                <li>It takes snapshots of the directory tree vs time and records only the incremental changes.
                </li>
                <li>A working copy, which is in fact, a local copy of a particular version of 
                    the repository is availiable for users to freely work on.
                    Note managing the version control of the working copy and communicating 
                    changes is the responsibility of the user.
                </li>
                <li>Using copy-modify-merge allows each user of the repository to have their 
                    own personal working copy and they can work simultaneously and independently 
                    to modify their personal copies which can then be merged together later. 
                    Note it is the humans' reponsibility to merge the files correctly and 
                    resolve any conflicts by manually.
                    This may mean choosing the correct file after discussions with any others 
                    editing the repository.
                </li>
                <li>Each change committed to the repository creates a new state of the 
                    filesystem tree (snapshot).
                    This is called a revision number.
                </li>
                <li>The revision number is applied to the entire repository tree and not 
                    individual files and is therefore also known as the Global Revision Number.
                    For example: at revision number N then a file may be the same as it was at 
                    revision number M but a <strong>different</strong> file was changed 
                    between the two revisions.

                When the offical version is released it will be removed and this section will point to the offical version.
                <li>It is recommended that you use <code>FCM</code>, which is a wrapper to Subversion, it has some additional user friendly functionality.</li>

                This is a testing system that checks to make sure that any code changes do not break any existing science that has a test.
                More tests are being added to provide robusness to the system.
                Rose stem is part of the JULES code and can be run by anyone that has a copy of the code.
