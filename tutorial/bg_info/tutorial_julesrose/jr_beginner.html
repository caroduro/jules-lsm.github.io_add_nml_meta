               JULES is the Joint UK Land Environment Simulation model, it is a community Land Surface Model (LSM). 
               The model can be used as a standalone model.
               It is also part of the Met Office weather and climate prediction models where it is used in the couple between the land and the atmopshere as part of the Met Office Unified Model (UM).

            <div class="well">
               JULES is used in the UK and worldwide for weather, climate and science research.
               JULES is used by meteorological services, universities, institutions and centres.
              JULES produces world class science and research.
              The code is hosted on the MOSRS which works with version control to provide a repository for all to access and browse.
             Version control allows for accountablilty, traceability and reproduceabilty.
             <p>Can you think of a scenerio when you version control would be advantagous in your current job/activity? Describe it.</p>
             <p>Describe how you share work now with collegues, could this be improved? How?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="well">
                Cylc is an intellegent workflow scheduling system that was created by Hilary Oliver at NWIA New Zealand.
                The <a href="https://cylc.github.io/cylc/documentation.html">documentation</a> descibes it in more detail.
               In summary:
               "Cylc was developed for the EcoConnect Forecasting System at NIWA (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand)."
               "Environmental forecasting suites generate forecast products from a potentially large group of interdependent scientific models and associated data processing tasks."
               Cylc is now not just used for forecasting models but for scheduling tasks on computers by people all over the world.
               Monterey - US Naval Research Laboratory use it for scheduling tasks on there computer systems.
                This is growing collaboration with people around the world, at p
resent there are 17 contributors, 11 of which are not Met Office UK.
                The code is hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/cylc/cylc">cylc/cylc</a>.

                <h2>What is Rose?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="well">
                Rose is a wrapper to Cylc.
                It was developed when the Met Office saw the potential power of Cylc and that it coud be made more user friendly but adding some additional functions around Cylc in the form of Rose.
                The Met Office wanted to work with NIWA to develop both Cylc and Rose for forecasting.
                This is growing collaboration with people around the world, at present there are 17 contributors, 4 of which are not Met Office UK.
                The code is hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/metomi/rose">metomi/rose</a>.
                The <a href="http://metomi.github.io/rose/doc/rose.html">Rose documentation</a> can be useful for background reading and a more detailed explaination for how the infrastructure works.

                <h2>Why used Rose/Cylc?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="well">
                Rose/Cylc provides a user friendly interface for JULES suites and allows them to be scheduled in the most efficent way using Cylc's clever algorithum (code).
                This means you just provide the order that you would like to run things in and it does the rest for you, submitting them once the dependancies have been meet.
                Rose/Cylc provides a user friendly interface for JULES code development with tests to check that your development has not broken someone else or some other code.
                Rose suites can be shared via the MOSRS using the "u-repository" and therefore you can choise an existing suite (bunch of tasks with the dependancies, inputs, outputs, all collected in one place) or adapt and existing suite for your own needs and run it to get your data.
               You can run bash, python, R, IDL scripts/tasks all as part of the suite, which means once it is set up you can run the suite and get on with a cuppa or some other work!
               Rose can retrieve data, archive data, remove data, plot data etc if you give it the correct tasks and tell it what the dependancies are.
               Rose means that you can run many suites with slightly different setting using the same base suite one straight after the other without having to wait for the first one to finish before running the next.
               Rose is meant to make your life easier so if it not try to figure out why and make it help.
               What work/activity/research that you are doing do you think you could use Rose/Cycl for?

                <h4>Key Features of Subversion:</h4>
                <li>It is an incremental change tracking system.</li>
                <li>We can explore the changes at each change and recall a version using its 
                    revision number.
                </li>
                <li>It takes snapshots of the directory tree vs time and records only the incremental changes.
                </li>
                <li>A working copy, which is in fact, a local copy of a particular version of 
                    the repository is availiable for users to freely work on.
                    Note managing the version control of the working copy and communicating 
                    changes is the responsibility of the user.
                </li>
                <li>Using copy-modify-merge allows each user of the repository to have their 
                    own personal working copy and they can work simultaneously and independently 
                    to modify their personal copies which can then be merged together later. 
                    Note it is the humans' reponsibility to merge the files correctly and 
                    resolve any conflicts by manually.
                    This may mean choosing the correct file after discussions with any others 
                    editing the repository.
                </li>
                <li>Each change committed to the repository creates a new state of the 
                    filesystem tree (snapshot).
                    This is called a revision number.
                </li>
                <li>The revision number is applied to the entire repository tree and not 
                    individual files and is therefore also known as the Global Revision Number.
                    For example: at revision number N then a file may be the same as it was at 
                    revision number M but a <strong>different</strong> file was changed 
                    between the two revisions.

            # or short-hand: fcm kp
            # this should return all of the keywords that you and the site have set-up, a sample of mine are:

            </font>
            </pre>
            <p>What are Keywords and why do we need them set-up?</p>
            <p>Keywords can be considerd to be like short-hand or short-cuts to our full URL's.
            <br>
             Keywords can be defined in the FCM keyword configuration file (i.e. 
             <samp>$FCM/etc/fcm/keyword.cfg</samp> and 
             <samp>$HOME/.metomi/fcm/keyword.cfg</samp>).
             <br>
            For <strong>example</strong> in our <samp>.cfg</samp> file in our $HOME
            directory we can define a keyword as follows:
            <pre>        location{primary}[jules.x] = https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/jules/main
            </pre>
            now we can abbreviate the URL as in the following examples:
            <pre>        # fcm ls https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/jules/main
            fcm ls fcm:jules.x
            </pre>
            There are two main advantages for using URL keywords, what do you think they 
            could be?

fcm add - for adding a file or directory to the repository
fcm bc - for creating a branch, can also use 'fcm branch-create'
fcm bd - for deleting a branch, can also use 'fcm branch-delete'
fcm bls - for listing the branches assocated with the repository, as default 
          this is only your branches, the '-a' option to list all other branches
          the '--user=kerryday' to list user kerryday's branches
fcm cf - for resolving text conflicts after a merge
fcm ci - for checking in a change to the repository
fcm co - for checking out a from the repository
fcm info - for getting info on the directory that you are working in
fcm merge - for merging in a branch
fcm rm - for removing a file or directory from the repository, option -c to 
         force it to remove the file from the repository even if it is missing
         from the directory
fcm revert - for reverting a file or directory which has not been 
             checked in/commited to the repository yet.
fcm st - for checking teh status of the repository, VERY IMPORTANT, more later
fcm sw - for switching branches, don't often done for code but great for suites
fcm up - for updating the respository

        under version control and add them.

    For other options, see output of "svn help add".

add: Put files and directories under version control, scheduling
them for addition to repository.  They will be added in next commit.
usage: add PATH...

Valid options:
  --targets ARG            : pass contents of file ARG as additional args
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; try --depth=files or --depth=immediates
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')

            The command <code>fcm st</code> is a very powerful command and one which 
            should be used frequently to aid with our use of FCM.
            <br/>
            <code>fcm st</code> returns the status of the local/working copy files and 
            directories.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Now we will look at the most common returned statuses including the meaning 
            of them and the implications on the repository.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Information on the status of the file or directory is given in the first seven
            columns.
            <ol>
            <li><sup>st</sup> column - added/deleted/changed

            '?' item is not under version control </font> - This may be an item that you 
            want to add to the repository. You do not have to, you may want to keep it
            outside of the repository because it is big or always changing. However, 
            remember that without adding it if the repository is checked out then the
            check out will not include this item.

            '!' item is missing (removed by non-svn command) or incomplete </font> - this
            item may have been deleted by a non-FCM command, you can solve this by using
            <samp>fcm rm -c &lt;FILE/DIRNAME&gt;</samp>
