               JULES is the Joint UK Land Environment Simulation model, it is a community Land Surface Model (LSM). 
               The model can be used as a standalone model.
               It is also part of the Met Office weather and climate prediction models where it is used in the couple between the land and the atmosphere as part of the Met Office Unified Model (UM).

               JULES is used in the UK and worldwide for weather, climate and science research.
               JULES is used by meteorological services, universities, institutions and centres.
              JULES produces world class science and research.
              The code is hosted on the MOSRS which works with version control to provide a repository for all to access and browse.
             Version control allows for accountability, traceability and reproduceability.
             <p>Can you think of a scenario when you version control would be advantageous in your current job/activity? Describe it.</p>
             <p>Describe how you share work now with colleagues, could this be improved? How?</p>

            <div class="well">
                Cylc is an intelligent workflow scheduling system that was created by Hilary Oliver at NWIA New Zealand.
                The <a href="https://cylc.github.io/cylc/documentation.html">documentation</a> describes it in more detail.
               In summary:
               "Cylc was developed for the EcoConnect Forecasting System at NIWA (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand)."
               "Environmental forecasting suites generate forecast products from a potentially large group of interdependent scientific models and associated data processing tasks."
               Cylc is now not just used for forecasting models but for scheduling tasks on computers by people all over the world.
               Monterey - US Naval Research Laboratory use it for scheduling tasks on there computer systems.
                This is growing collaboration with people around the world, at present there are 17 contributors, 11 of which are not Met Office UK.
                The code is hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/cylc/cylc">cylc/cylc</a>.

                <h2>What is Rose?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="well">
                Rose is a wrapper to Cylc.
                It was developed when the Met Office saw the potential power of Cylc and that it could be made more user friendly but adding some additional functions around Cylc in the form of Rose.
                The Met Office wanted to work with NIWA to develop both Cylc and Rose for forecasting.
                This is growing collaboration with people around the world, at present there are 17 contributors, 4 of which are not Met Office UK.
                The code is hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/metomi/rose">metomi/rose</a>.
                The <a href="http://metomi.github.io/rose/doc/rose.html">Rose documentation</a> can be useful for background reading and a more detailed explanation for how the infrastructure works.

                <h2>Why use Rose/Cylc?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="well">
                Rose/Cylc provides a user friendly interface for JULES suites and allows them to be scheduled in the most efficient way using Cylc's clever algorithm (code).
                This means you just provide the order that you would like to run things in and it does the rest for you, submitting them once the dependencies have been meet.
                Rose/Cylc provides a user friendly interface for JULES code development with tests to check that your development has not broken someone else or some other code.
                Rose suites can be shared via the MOSRS using the "u-repository" and therefore you can choose an existing suite (bunch of tasks with the dependencies, inputs, outputs, all collected in one place) or adapt and existing suite for your own needs and run it to get your data.
               You can run bash, python, R, IDL scripts/tasks all as part of the suite, which means once it is set up you can run the suite and get on with a cuppa or some other work!
               Rose can retrieve data, archive data, remove data, plot data etc if you give it the correct tasks and tell it what the dependencies are.
               Rose means that you can run many suites with slightly different setting using the same base suite one straight after the other without having to wait for the first one to finish before running the next.
               Rose is meant to make your life easier so if it not try to figure out why and make it help.
               What work/activity/research that you are doing do you think you could use Rose/Cylc for?

            </div>
            <div class="well">
                <h4>Key Features of Subversion:</h4>
                <li>It is an incremental change tracking system.</li>
                <li>We can explore the changes at each change and recall a version using its 
                    revision number.
                </li>
                <li>It takes snapshots of the directory tree vs time and records only the incremental changes.
                </li>
                <li>A working copy, which is in fact, a local copy of a particular version of 
                    the repository is available for users to freely work on.
                    Note managing the version control of the working copy and communicating 
                    changes is the responsibility of the user.
                </li>
                <li>Using copy-modify-merge allows each user of the repository to have their 
                    own personal working copy and they can work simultaneously and independently 
                    to modify their personal copies which can then be merged together later. 
                    Note it is the humans' responsibility to merge the files correctly and 
                    resolve any conflicts by manually.
                    This may mean choosing the correct file after discussions with any others 
                    editing the repository.
                </li>
                <li>Each change committed to the repository creates a new state of the 
                    filesystem tree (snapshot).
                    This is called a revision number.
                </li>
                <li>The revision number is applied to the entire repository tree and not 
                    individual files and is therefore also known as the Global Revision Number.
                    For example: at revision number N then a file may be the same as it was at 
                    revision number M but a <strong>different</strong> file was changed 
                    between the two revisions.

            <pre>
            rosie hello --prefix=u
            # this should return something like this:
            <font color="blue">

            7.3.0
            FCM 2017.02.0 (/net/home/.../fcm-2017.02.0)
            </font>
            # hopefully they are the latest versions of the systems.
            fcm keyword-print
            # or short-hand: fcm kp
            # this should return all of the keywords that you and the site have setup, a sample of mine are:
            <font color="blue">
            location{primary}[jules.x] = https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/jules/main
            location{primary}[jules_doc.x] = https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/jules/doc
            </font>
            </pre>
            <p>What are Keywords and why do we need them setup?</p>
            <p>Keywords can be considered to be like short-hand or short-cuts to our full URL's.
            <br/>
             Keywords can be defined in the FCM keyword configuration file (i.e. 
             <samp>$FCM/etc/fcm/keyword.cfg</samp> and 
             <samp>$HOME/.metomi/fcm/keyword.cfg</samp>).
             <br/>
            For <strong>example</strong> in our <samp>.cfg</samp> file in our $HOME
            directory we can define a keyword as follows:
            <pre>        location{primary}[jules.x] = https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/jules/main
            </pre>
            now we can abbreviate the URL as in the following examples:
            <pre>        # fcm ls https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/jules/main
            fcm ls fcm:jules.x
            </pre>
            There are two main advantages for using URL keywords, what do you think they 
            could be?

fcm add - for adding a file or directory to the repository
fcm bc - for creating a branch, can also use 'fcm branch-create'
fcm bd - for deleting a branch, can also use 'fcm branch-delete'
fcm bls - for listing the branches associated with the repository, as default 
          this is only your branches, the '-a' option to list all other branches
          the '--user=kerryday' to list user kerryday's branches
fcm cf - for resolving text conflicts after a merge
fcm ci - for checking in a change to the repository
fcm co - for checking out a from the repository
fcm info - for getting info on the directory that you are working in
fcm merge - for merging in a branch
fcm rm - for removing a file or directory from the repository, option -c to 
         force it to remove the file from the repository even if it is missing
         from the directory
fcm revert - for reverting a file or directory which has not been 
             checked in/committed to the repository yet.
fcm st - for checking the status of the repository, VERY IMPORTANT, more later
fcm sw - for switching branches, don't often done for code but great for suites
fcm up - for updating the repository

            <p>More on fcm st</p>
            The command <code>fcm st</code> is a very powerful command and one which 
            should be used frequently to aid with our use of FCM.
            <br/>
            <code>fcm st</code> returns the status of the local/working copy files and 
            directories.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Now we will look at the most common returned statuses including the meaning 
            of them and the implications on the repository.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Information on the status of the file or directory is given in the first seven
            columns.
            <ol>
            <li><sup>st</sup> column - added/deleted/changed

Rose-stem is a collection of tests in a suite.
It is used to test as much of the code and science as possible.
This means developers can prove that any change does not break other code and
or science and is bit compatible with the previous run checking Known Good
Output (KGO).
Rose-stem can test on different platforms and with different compliers.
Ideally all sites will have their own rose-stem tests that they run, preferably,
weekly.

            <p>We are now going to run the rose-stem tests purely as a 
               demonstration of a JULES running with Rose.</p>
            <p>We always need to specify a group when running rose-stem, here 
               we will use <code>--group=all</code>.
               Other possible options are <code>loobos</code>, <code>gswp2</code>, 
               <code>linux</code>, <code>xc40</code>, <code>tutorial</code>, 
               <code>tutorial_linux</code>, <code>tutorial_xc40</code>.
            </p>
            <p>If you forget the <code>--group=...</code> option you will get 
               an error like the following:
<pre>
<font color=red>[FAIL]</font> cylc validate -v --strict fred # return-code=1, stderr=
<font color=red>[FAIL]</font> 'No suite dependency graph defined.'
</pre>
           </p>
<pre>
rose stem --group=all --new -- --hold
</pre>
            <p>This will set it running but not allow it to start as we have 
               used the option <code>-- --hold</code>.</p>
            <p>The option <code>--new</code> forces a completly new run to be
               created.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Rose and Cylc provide many helpful Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's).</p>
            <br/>
           Now lets explore the GUI's.
           <h3>The cylc gcylc GUI</h3>
           <p>We will now discuss the gcylc GUI functionality ready for running 
              suites in the next practical.</p>
           <p>The cylc gcylc GUI is the suite specific Graphical User 
              Interface for monitoring the progress of a specific suite.</p>
           <p>Note you can have a unique gcylc's open for different each suite.</p>
           <p>A JULES-Rose gcylc GUI could look like this:</p>
           <img src="images/uai828_demo_1.png" width="60%" id="cgd1"/>
           <br/>
           <p>Lets look at an image of a running gcylc GUI and try to 
              understand the different aspects of it.</p>
           <h4>Key points from the gcylc GUI</h4>
           <ol>
           <li>The square coloured blocks - theses are the current states of the tasks
           <br/><img src="images/task_filtering.png" width="35%" id="tf"/></li>
           <li>If there is an "F" inside the square blocks - this denotes that
               it is part of a family of tasks, these can be considers as a
               common group.</li>
           <li>When a task has run you can look at its standard output via the 
           GUI by right clicking on the task name.
           For example, fcm_make:
           <br/><img src="images/u_ai828_demo_2.png" width="60%" id="cgd2"/>
           <br/>Then you can look at the standard out, err and interact with
           the task.</li>
           <li>We can pause or stop the suite using the buttons at the top left
           of the gcylc GUI or by selecting the <code>Control</code> tab
           <br/><img src="images/u_ai828_demo_3.png" width="60%" id="cgd3"/>
           <br/><img src="images/stop_suite_daemon.png" width="35%" id="ssd"/>
           <br/>Note in the last image in the top taskbar it says:
           <code>Stop Suite Daemon vn4p8</code> this means that this panel 
           can be used to stop the suite at the location it is running using 
           the suite daemon.
           Which is the computer program that runs as a background process.</li>
           There are many other functions that we will learn about through the
           tutorial but these are the basics.
            <br/>

</font>
<li>In the image above in 5. What is the state of the

<font color=green>
succeeded, it is a grey square and the 'state' column say 'succeeded'.
</font>
<li>What two ways could you pause a suite?</li>
<font color=green>
Pause button on the top left or 'Control' and select 'Hold Suite (pause)'
</font>
<li>Why do you think that you may want to kill a suite and how would you do so?</li>
<font color=green>
There are mainly reasons, for example it failed and you need to fix the error.
'Control' tab, select 'Stop Suite', select 'Stop after killing active tasks'
</font>

            <h4>What if you do not have access to a GUI?</h4>
            <p>There is a command line equivalent, it is not as elegant: </p>
            <code>cylc scan -c</code>
            <p>It should produce something like this:</p>
            <br/><img src="images/cylc_scanc.png" id="csc"/>
            <br/>
            <p>the very top line show the meaning of all of the colours that
               are used in the summary of the state of the suite.</p>
            <p>Next there is the name of the suite, i.e. r6400_rfm_dump.</p>
            <p>On the same line is the username and the location that the suite
               is being run, i.e. kday002 and localhost7766.</p>
           <p>Now the <code>Task state totals:</code> are given.</p>
            <p>The top line of the Task state totals shows the summary state of 
               the whole suite.
               The second line show the summary state of the current cycle, 
               which for JULES is usually <code>cycle 1</code>.
               There are no other cycles for any of the suites above.</p>
            <p>From the <code>jlstr_479_KGO</code> suite summary their are 
               1 ready tasks,<br/> 18 running tasks,<br/> 3 submitted,<br/>
               63 succeeded and<br/>
               22 waiting tasks.</p>
               
            <br/>
            <h4>What if you accidently close the gcylc GUI?</h4>
            <p>You can reopen it using:</p>
            <code>cylc gui vn4p8 #where vn4p8 is the suite id</code>
            <br/>OR
            <p>You can use the cylc gscan GUI</p>
            <code>cylc gscan &amp; #&amp; background the task so you can still use your terminal</code>
            <br/>
            <br/><img src="images/cylc_gscan.png" id="cgscan"/>
            <br/>
            <p>Now you can double click on the suite id of the suite that you
            want to open and the gcylc GUI of that will appear.</p>
            <br/>OR
            <p>You can use Rose to open the gcylc GUI</p>
            <code>rose suite-gcontrol --name=SUITE-NAME</code> Or the shorthand
            <code> rose sgc --name=SUITE-NAME</code>
            <br/>
            <h4>How else could we look at the output from the suite?</h4>
            <p>We already know that we can use the gcylc GUI to look at the 
               job stderr/out by <strong>right click</strong> on a task and
               select <strong>View</strong> and then the job stderr.
               We may also want to look at the log file for the suite.</p>
            <p>This can be viewed in via the gcylc GUI if there are errors.
               If there are errors then a orange warning triangle will appear
               in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.</p>

            <p>Double clicking on it will open up an information box with any
               errors from the log of the suite.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>Other ways of looking at information from the suite:</h4>
            <p>We can, if it is setup look at the information in a web 
               browser.</p>
            <p>This is known as <strong>rose bush</strong>.</p>
            <p>At the Met Office the top level page looks like the image
               below.</p>
            <img src="images/rose_bush1.png" width="85%" id="rb1"/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>At the Met Office the second level page looks like the image
               below.
               This was reached by completing the "User Id" and selecting the
               "Suite List" button.
               This then provides a list of the owners suites that they have 
               run and or are running.</p>
            <img src="images/rose_bush2.png" width="95%" id="rb2"/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>At the Met Office the suite level page looks like the image
               below.
               The suite was selected by clicking on the "task jobs list" 
               associated with the desired suite name.</p>
            <img src="images/rose_bush3.png" width="85%" id="rb3"/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>On the Virtual Machine (VM) the suite level page looks like the image below.</p>
            <img src="images/vm_rose_bush.png" width="85%"id="vmrb"/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>The last two images are equivalent run on two different
               sites/systems.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Depending on your site setup there are different ways of 
               accessing rose bush.
               As can be seen in the above two images.
               In an internet window if you know the path you can use that.</p>
            <p>At command line rose bush can be invoked for a suite that you 
               have run or is running from within the directory of the 
               suite.</p>
            <p><code>rose slv</code> or <code>rose suite-log --view</code> you
               can also add the option of the <code>--name=SUITE_NAME</code>
           <br/>

            <p>Using the "Display Options" button to search for tasks by...
            <br/>
            ...name (using the Task Name Glob) which means you can search for 
            part of a name, for example <code>*linux*</code>
            <br/>
            ...specifying the number of Entries/Page is helpful for both very 
            large suites, especially when combined with other options
            <br/>
            ...the Sort Order drop down is a useful option for example looking
            at the first failed task
            <br/>
            ...you can combine options

            <p>The "Display Options" also includes a very useful function of
               being able to look at jobs via their task status.</p> 
            <p>This can be done by selecting the Job Status drop down box.</p>
            <p>You can then search by the status of the task.</p>
            <p>For example searching for all Failed tasks is often very helpful.

            <p>As you can see below this functionality is not utilised for
               rose-stem suites.</p>

            <h4>The cylc-run directory</h4>
            <p>A third place that we can look at the logs for a suite is
               in the <code>cylc-run</code> directory.</p>
            <p>This directory is created by Cylc at the time that the run is 
               started, it is populated by Cylc.</p>
            <p>The cylc-run directory is the location where the information, 
               logs and data are sent to.</p>
            <p>The directory structure often looks like this:</p>
            <pre>
app                    include               suite.rc
bin                    log                   suite.rc.processed
cylc-suite-env         log.20161223T075541Z  work
cylc-suite-private.db  meta                  
cylc-suite-public.db   passphrase
cylc-suite.db          share
           </pre>
           <p>The <code>log*/</code> directories are where all of the logs are 
              located.</p>
           <p>The <code>log/suite/</code> is where the suite logs are found.</p>
           <p>The <code>log/job/1/</code> is where the logs for each task is
              found.
              This includes the <code>job stderr, job stdout</code>.</p>
           <p>The <code>work/1/</code> directory is where the output for each
              task is.</p>
           <p>The <code>share/</code> directory is where any shared data or
              cycle specific data is stored.</p>
           <p>Note not all JULES-Rose suites are cycling suite so there is only 
              <code>1</code> cycle, which is also why the directories above 
              have a <code>1</code> in there path.</p>
           <p>FYI a <code>trac.log</code> is created once the suite has stopped,
              but ONLY for rose-stem tests which we will go into in the next
              tutorial. It is required for code development evidence in the
              TicketSummary only.</p>
           <p>The <code>app</code>, <code>bin</code>, <code>suite.rc</code>,
              <code>include</code> and <code>meta</code> are all the same as 
              are be found in the <code>rose-stem/</code> directory.</p>
           <p>The <code>suite.rc.processed</code> is the suite.rc but with any
              <code>Jinja2</code>, explained later, expanded fully, with all
              variables and loops expanded.</p>
           <p>The <code>cylc-suite*</code> files are database files for Rose
              Bush etc.</p>
           <p>The <code>passphase</code> is a communications level file.</p>

            <p>Now we know some of the more regularly used functionality of the
               gcylc GUI we should let our rose-stem suite run.</p>
            <p>Release the suite using the <code>Play</code> button on the top
               left of the gcylc GUI.</p>
            <p>Have a look around the gcylc GUI and find some of the functions
               discussed above, but <strong>DO NOT Stop</strong> the suite as 
               we want to prove that the JULES trunk code is successful!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Bring up <code>Rose Bush</code> and have a look around, note

            <h3>Tickets</h3>
            <p>A brief description and discussion on tickets</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Even if you never have any intention of making a ticket which 
               you hope resolve tickets can be used to highlight bugs, when 
               something has been broken, or areas of development.
               Therefore it is helpful to understand them, their uses, how to
               create a ticket and or just keep any eye on tickets that may
               be of interest to the science that you are working on.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>JULES code is part of the MOSRS, as part of the system there is
               a Trac system.
            <h4>Trac</h4>
            <p>Trac is a wiki system which we can use for organizing knowledge
               and information in a way that FCM can interact with.</p>
            <p>A brief summary on Trac:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>It is a flexible issue tracker.</li>
            <li>It provides a roadmap feature for managing project release,
                including a record of all changes included in the release.</li>
            <li>It has a built-in wiki.</li>
            <li>It lets us use a browser for viewing the repositories, where
                we can browse the code and files, examine revision logs and 
                changesets.</li>
           <li>It provides a timeline view with summaries of changes to.</li>
           <li>It provides a flexible ticket workflow, supporting the
               review process.</li>
           </ul>
           <h4>Trac Tickets</h4>
           <p>From the JULES MOSRS <a href="https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/jules">homepage</a>
              select <code>View Tickets</code> if you are the <code>Owner</code>
              of any tickets this will bring them up for you to see.</p>

                     on a ticket or a owner</li>
                 <li>You can add and remove Filters, try removing the Owner and 
                     adding a Milestone</li>

               right of the page and fill in the details.
               The Description will need a link to the branch before it is
               passed for review.
               For example <code>[log:main/branches/dev/kerryday/vn4.8_new_tests vn4.8_new_tests]</code>
               and a Ticket Summary page <code>[wiki:ticket/###/TicketSummary ticket summary]</code>
              These make it easier for the reviewer.</p>
              <p>If you are only reporting a bug then please fill in as much as
                 possible with evidence and try to find a suitable person to

                  <p>Run the JULES-Rose suite</p>
               <br/>
               <p>In this practical we will use two different methods, command
                  line and GUI's for all of the tasks.</p>
               <p>Please try both and then chose which you prefer, but remember,
                  you can mix and match and always change your mind!</p>
               <br/>
               <h3>Check out a JULES-Rose suite</h3>
               <p>We are going to checkout the JULES-Rose suite, u-ai828.</p>
               <p>It is one from the MOSRS, the <code>u</code> refers to the
                  suite being part of the MOSRS Rosie Repository.</p>
               <p><code>ai828</code> is a unique "number" assigned by the Rosie
                  Repository to the suite.
                  The "number" is incremental, no two suites can have the 
                  same number, also you cannot choose the number.</p>
               <pre>
rosie checkout u-ai828 # or u-ai829 for running on the VM or u-ai843 for JASMIN or u-al388 for MONSooN
<font color=blue>

               <br/>
               <h3>JULES-Rose suite structure</h3>
               <p>The suite structure is similar for all suites.</p>
               <pre>
cd /USER/roses/u-ai828 # or u-ai829 for running on the VM or u-ai843 for JASMIN or u-al388 for MONSooN 
ls
<font color=blue>
app  meta  rose-suite.conf  rose-suite.info  suite.rc
</font>
</pre>
               <p>The suite only contains plain text files, so all of the 
                  contents can be read with a text editor.</p>
               <p>The <code>app/</code> and the <code>meta</code> are 
                  directories.
                  The <code>rose-suite.conf</code>, <code>rose-suite.info</code>
                  and the <code>suite.rc</code> are text files.</p>
              <ol>
                  <li>The <code>rose-suite.info</code> file contains information
                      on the suite that is searchable in Rosie Go (see below).
                  </li>
                  <li>The <code>rose-suite.conf</code> is where you should find
                      all of the variables that you may have to change.</li>
                  <li>The <code>suite.rc</code> is the Runtime Configuration
                      file for the suite.
                      It contains the <code>graph</code> section for the running
                      order of the tasks in the suite.
                      The task names and the environment variables that they
                      need which may be from the <code>rose-suite.conf</code>.
                      Directives, Submission Methods, etc.
                      In this file there is not just Python code but Jinja2, 
                      a templating language in Python, don't worry we will
                      discuss it when we need to make changes.</li>
                    <li>The <code>app/</code> directory contains the 
                        Applications, for example <code>fcm_make</code> and the
                        <code>jules</code> app's with their 
                        <code>rose-app.conf</code> configurations files.</li>
                    <li>The <code>meta/</code> directory contains the
                        metadata for the suite, which helps you to understand
                        the values and parameters in the suite.</li>
               </ol>
               <br/>
               <p>Some suites have more directories, some contain data.</p>
               <p>There is some data in this suite, can you find it?
                  It is Loobos data.</p>

            <p>We will go into each file in detail as we interact with them
               below in the practicals.</p>
               <br/>
               <p>The command line technique is great if you know the suite ID 
                  that you wish to checkout.
                  But if you do not know or cannot remember the suite ID we
                  can look it up based on the information in the 
                  <code>rose-suite.info</code> file using Rosie Go</p>
               <h3>Rosie Go</h3>
               <p>Rosie Go is the suite browser GUI</p>
               <p>First lets check your setup, open your
                   <code>.metomi/rose.conf</code> file, it should include 
                   similar to the following output.</p>
<pre>
<font color=blue>
[rosie-id]
prefix-username.u=MOSRS_USERNAME
prefixes-ws-default=u
</font>
</pre>
                <p>Now we can open Rosie Go by:</p>
<pre>
cd
rosie go &amp;
</pre>
               <br/>
               <img src="images/rosie_go.png" width="90%" id="rgo"/>
               <br/>
               <p>Search for all of the user "kerryday"'s suites using the 
                  search box at the top far right of the Rosie Go GUI.</p>
               <p>Hover your mouse over each of the icons on the far left of
                  the Rosie Go GUI and find out what each of the images mean.</p
>
               <p>Please note difference in icons etc are likely as different
                  systems and desktops have different Apperance Preferences set.</p>

               <p>You can search for anything that may be in the

               <p>Right click on the suite that you are interested in.</p>
               <img src="images/rosie_go2.png" width="90%" id="rgo2"/>
               <p>Note that the <code>Checkout Suite</code> option is greyed
                  out, this is because we already have a copy.
                  However if we want we can chose to 
                  <code>Delete Working Copy</code> and then 
                  <code>Checkout Suite</code> to prove it works the same as
                  command line.</p>
               <br/>
               <p>Notice we can do many other things from the Rosie Go GUI.</p>
               <p>Next we will use it to open <code>Rose Edit</code>.<p/>
               <h3>Rose Edit</h3>
               <p>There are three ways to open Rose Edit:
                  <ol>
                     <li>Command line
<pre>

</pre>
</li>
                     <li>Rosie Go GUI - double click on the suite of interest.</li>
                     <li>Rosie Go GUI - right click on the suite of interest 
                         and select <code>Edit Suite</code></li>
                    </p>
                    <p>Click on the different items in the <code>Index</code>
                       on the left hand side of the panel of the Rose Edit GUI.

                  <p>Copying a JULES-Rose suite, edit the rose-suite.info.</p>
                  <p>Change the output period, output directory location etc.</p>

                <h4>Intro and background</h4>
                  <p>This practical changes the soil ancillaries corresponding
                     to a different soil type.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Soil ancillaries have an important effect on hydrology and
                   thermodynamics.
                   They affect sensible and latent heat fluxes that are passed
                   back to the atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>The paper by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR020i006p00682/pdf">Cosby et. al. (1984)</a> defines a range of distinct soil types.
                   </p>
                   <p>Please note these are not considered by all as the optimum setting but are only for example purposes here.
                    Cosby's parameter values were valid for the USA only: for runs at other locations please consult other sources e.g. the <a href="http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-survey/soil-maps-and-databases/harmonized-world-soil-database-v12/en/">HWSD</a>.

                  <h4>Hints and Tips for using Rose Edit for making changes</h4>
                  <ul>
                 <li>The gear-wheel icon near the variable name is clickable, with several useful functions, including taking you to the documentation.</li>
                  <li>If you can't see the variable you want, try right-clicking to add latent variable.</li>
                  </li>To alter the soil ancillaries, you can enter the data into the Rose Edit GUI manually.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The following instructions are for changes at command line,
                     but will also help with changes in the Rose Edit GUI.</p>
                  <h3>Change the output period, output directory location etc.</h3>
                  <ol>
                  <li>Change the output period to be daily (86400 seconds).
                  <p>In the <code>app/jules/rose-app.conf</code> file change</p> 
<pre>
[namelist:jules_output_profile(1)]
output_period=86400
</pre>
</li>
                  <li>Ensure that gridbox mean sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and surface temperature are output.
                  <p<a href="http://jules-lsm.github.io/vn4.8/output-variables.html">JULES Output variables</a></p>
<pre>
ftl_gb 	Gridbox surface sensible heat flux (W m-2)
latent_heat 	Gridbox surface latent heat flux (W m-2)
tstar_gb 	Gridbox surface temperature (K)
</pre>
<p>Check these variables are present in the <code>app/jules/rose-app.conf</code>
 file in the <code>[namelist:jules_output_profile(1)]</code> section and if 
not add them.</p>

</li>
                  <li>Change the output directory name, create the relevant directory, change the run ID.
                  <p> In the <code>app/jules/rose-app.conf</code> file below the 
<pre>

                     To switch back to the original use <code>fcm sw trunk</code>
                     <strong>BUT first always remember to commit your changes
                     back to the branch using</strong> <code>fcm ci</code>
                     <strong>before switching</strong>.

                 </ol>
                 <br/>
                 <p>The first method is the simplest, but I personally prefer the
                    second as it groups similar suites together with one id.</p>

When plotting the differences the small difference may not be observable by eye

For example it has been noted that ncview does not appear to display differences
clearly by eye but MatLab and Iris display the difference.</p>

                  <p>Changing canopy the radiation model configurations</p>
                  <p>Changing the JULES-Rose suite design to run JULES for multiple configurations</p>

                  <p>Adding plots</p>
               <br/>
               <p>
               In Practical 5 we copied the suite three times, sand, loam and clay.
               Each had its own suite id and we ran each suite to get the results.
               However, this is not the most effective way of running the suite to
               get the data as each time it run the <code>fcm_make</code> task.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>This time we want to run the suite for six different model configurations.
                 Each is only a one line change, it would be a waste of resource
                 to have six different suites and run each so we will used the 
                 functionality of Rose to make this more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>Cylc/Rose will schedule the jules tasks to run simultaneously
               which will reduce the running time of your suite.</p>
            <h3>Changing canopy the radiation model configurations</h3>
               <p>Information on the options in JULES for calculating the effect
                  of the vegetation canopy on radiation is in the <a href="http://jules-lsm.github.io/vn4.8/namelists/jules_vegetation.nml.html#JULES_VEGETATION::can_rad_mod">documentation.</a></p>
              In summary, in the <code>jules</code> application configuration
              file <code>SUITE_ID/app/jules/rose-app.conf</code> the namelist 
              <code>jules_vegetation</code> has an option <code>can_rad_mod</code>.

              <p>
              What is the default set to in <code>u-ai828/u-ai829/u-ai843/u-al388</code>? 
              What two ways can you find the value?

command line, view the file u-ai828/app/jules/rose-app.conf

OR

rose edit
First check the metadata is pointing to the correct location (change to point to your copy of the code)
e.g.
for jules ~kerryday/JULES/vn4p8/trunk/rose-metadata/jules-standalone/vn4.8 
for fcm_make ~kerryday/JULES/vn4p8/trunk/rose-metadata/jules-fcm-make/vn4.8
Refresh the metadata using the Metadata tab at the top of rose edit.
Then:
 -&gt; jules -&gt; Namelist configuration -&gt; Sciecne settings -&gt; Vegetation options <code>can_rad_mod</code> (about half way down). REMEMBER to expand your rose edit window to see all of the options.

            <h3>Changing the JULES-Rose suite design to run JULES for multiple configurations</h3>
            <p>To change the suite design we have to edit the text files in the
               suite using a text editor.</p>
            <p>First we must either copy <code>u-ai828/u-ai829/u-ai843/u-al388</code> or create
               a branch of either <code>u-ai828/u-ai829/u-ai843/u-al388</code> and then switch to it.

            <p>Now we can make changes to the suite.</p>
            <p>
            <ol>
            <li>We need to edit the <code>rose-suite.conf</code> file to 
                include a list of the different radiation models.
                For Example 
<pre>
CANRADMOD=['canradmod_1', 'canradmod_2', 'canradmod_3', 'canradmod_4', 'canradmod_5', 'canradmod_6']
</pre></li>
            <li>We need to change the <code>graph</code> section in the
                <code>suite.rc</code> to loop through the list in the
                <code>rose-suite.conf</code>. For Example
<pre>
        graph = """
                {% for crm in CANRADMOD %}

                <code>rose-suite.conf</code> and for it to use the optional

A pad of paper and a hand with a pointing finger on the paper are next to the 
can_rad_mod option in the namelist.
This means that there are optional configurations, if you click on the icon
it displays the optional configurations, note there is none for canradmod_4 as
it is the same as the default option.

If you click on the icon rose edit looks like:

<img src="images/prac6_trac1.png" width="95%" id="p6_tp1"/>
                 <p>Here CANRADMOD" has been added so that the list in the correct format for the Python plotting.</p>
                <li><code>suite.rc</code></li>
<img src="images/prac6_trac2.png" width="95%" id="p6_t2"/>
                <p>Here the family <code>[[JULES]]</code> has been added and
                  then used in the <code>graph</code> section for the
                  dependency of the <code>jules</code> tasks must all 
                  succeed before the plotting task <code>plot_crm</code> can
                  run.
                  All <code>jules</code> task now inherit the <code>JULES</code>
                  family for this to happen.
                  A new task of <code>[[plot_crm]]</code> has been added, it                      runs the script <code>plot_crm.py</code> with the arguments
                  <code>CYLC_SUITE_NAME</code> a variable assigned at run time,                   it will use the optional name if provided and 
                  <code>CANRADMOD2</code>, the list of models in the required
                 format.</p>

                <h4>Some new things from running this suite in the gcylc GUI</h4>
                <p>The image below shows two <code>Views</code> the "Graph" view
                   in the top section of the gcylc GUI, View 1, and the "Text"
                   view in the bottom section as View 2.</p>
                <p>One other thing to notice in the Graph View is that the JULES
                   family is grouped together, to un-group it select the second
                   button after the Views button to expand the family.</p>
