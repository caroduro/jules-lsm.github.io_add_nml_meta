``JULES_SNOW`` namelist members
-------------------------------

HCTN30 refers to Hadley Centre technical note 30, available from `the Met Office Library <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/library/publications/science/climate-science-technical-notes>`_.


.. nml:namelist:: JULES_SNOW

.. nml:member:: nsmax

   :type: integer
   :permitted: >= 0
   :default: 0

   Maximum possible number of snow layers.

   0
       A composite soil/snow layer is used. This value gives the behaviour found in JULES2.0 and earlier.

   > 0
       The state of up to ``nsmax`` separate snow layers is modelled. Values of ``nsmax = 3`` or more are recommended.


.. nml:member:: l_snowdep_surf

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   TRUE
       Use equivalent canopy snow depth for surface calculations on tiles with a snow canopy.

   FALSE
       No effect.
       
       
.. nml:member:: frac_snow_subl_melt

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 0 or 1
   :default: 0
   
   Switch for use of snow-cover fraction in the calculation of sublimation and melting.
   
   0. Off
   1. On


.. nml:member:: graupel_options

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 0 or 1 or 2
   :default: 0
   
   Switch for treatment of graupel in the snow scheme
   
   0. Include graupel as snowfall
   1. Ignore graupel in the surface snowfall
   2. Treat graupel separately

   Always "Include graupel as snowfall" (option 0) in standalone JULES because 
   separate snow and graupel driving data are not available.
   If graupel is included in the UM surface snowfall diagnostic 
   then JULES can either include this graupel as snow in the surface scheme (option 0), 
   ignore this graupel completely, thereby breaking conservation
   of water and energy in the coupled land-atmosphere model (option 1) or 
   treat graupel seperately (currently this only means allowing graupel to
   fall straight through the canopy)
   

.. nml:member:: dzsnow

   :type: real(nsmax)
   :default: None

   Prescribed thickness of each snow layer (m).

   Only used if :nml:mem:`nsmax` > 0.

   The interpretation of ``dzsnow`` is slightly complicated and an example of the evolution of the snow layers is given below.

   ``dzsnow`` gives the thickness of each layer when it is not the bottom layer.

   For the top layer, the minimum thickness is ``dzsnow(1)`` and the maximum thickness is ``2 * dzsnow(1)``. For all other layers ``iz``, the minimum thickness is ``dzsnow(iz - 1)``, i.e. the given thickness of the previous layer, and the maximum thickness is ``2 * dzsnow(iz)``, i.e. twice the layer ``dzsnow`` value, except for the last possible layer (:nml:mem:`nsmax`) which has no upper limit.

   As a snowpack deepens, the bottom layer (closest to the soil; label this as layer ``b``) thickens until it reaches its maximum allowed thickness, at which point it will split into a layer of depth ``dzsnow(b)`` and a new bottom layer ``b + 1`` is added to hold the remaining snow. If a layer becomes thinner than its value in ``dzsnow`` it is removed and the snow partitioned between the remaining layers. Whenever a layer splits or is removed, the properties of the layer (e.g. temperature) are allocated to the remaining layers.

   Note that ``dzsnow(nsmax)``, the final thickness, is not used but a value must be input.


.. nml:member:: cansnowpft

   :type: logical(npft)
   :default: F

   Flag indicating whether snow can be held under the canopy of each PFT.

   Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::can_model` = 4.

   The model of snow under the canopy is currently only suitable for coniferous trees.

   TRUE
       Snow can be held under the canopy.

   FALSE
       Snow cannot be held under the canopy.


.. nml:group:: Radiation parameters

   .. nml:member:: r0

      :type: real
      :default: 50.0

      Grain size for fresh snow (\ |mu|\ m).

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_RADIATION::l_snow_albedo` = TRUE. See HCTN30 Eq.15.


   .. nml:member:: rmax

      :type: real
      :default: 2000.0

      Maximum snow grain size (\ |mu|\ m).

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_RADIATION::l_snow_albedo` = TRUE. See HCTN30 p4.


   .. nml:member:: snow_ggr

      :type: real(3)
      :default: 0.6, 0.06, 0.23e6

      Snow grain area growth rates (\ |mu|\ m\ :sup:`2` s\ :sup:`-1`).

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_RADIATION::l_snow_albedo` = TRUE. See HCTN30 Eq.16.

      The 3 values are for melting snow, cold fresh snow and cold aged snow respectively.


   .. nml:member:: amax

      :type: real(2)
      :default: 0.98, 0.7

      Maximum albedo for fresh snow.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_RADIATION::l_snow_albedo` or :nml:mem:`JULES_SURFACE::l_elev_land_ice`
      are true

      Values 1 and 2 are for VIS and NIR wavebands respectively.

   .. nml:member:: aicemax

      :type: real(2)
      :default: 0.78, 0.36

      Maximum albedo for bare ice

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_SURFACE::l_elev_land_ice` = TRUE. See also `rho_firn_albedo`

      Values 1 and 2 are for VIS and NIR wavebands respectively.


   .. nml:member:: maskd

      :type: real
      :default: 50.0

      Used in exponent of equation weighting snow-covered and snow-free albedo.


   .. nml:member:: dtland

      :type: real
      :default: 2.0

      Degrees Celsius below zero at which snow albedo equals cold deep snow albedo.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_RADIATION::l_snow_albedo` = FALSE. This is 2.0 in HCTN30 Eq4.


   .. nml:member:: kland_numerator

      :type: real
      :default: 0.3

      Used in snow-ageing effect on albedo.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_RADIATION::l_snow_albedo` = FALSE.

      Must not be zero.

      ``kland`` is computed by dividing this value by :nml:mem:`dtland` - see HCTN30 Eq4.


   .. nml:member:: can_clump

      :type: real(npft)
      :default: MDI

      Clumping parameter for snow on the canopy in calculation of albedo.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::can_model` = 4, :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::cansnowpft` = TRUE on that tile and :nml:mem:`JULES_RADIATION::l_embedded_snow` = TRUE.

      The model of snow under the canopy is currently only suitable
      for coniferous trees.

      The inverse of this parameter specifies the fraction of the
      canopy over which snow is distributed when calculating the albedo.


   .. nml:member:: n_lai_exposed

      :type: real(npft)
      :default: MDI

      LAI distribution parameter for calculation of snow albedo.

      A power-law distribution of leaf area density is assumed within
      the canopy for calculating masking of snow by vegetation using
      the embedded scheme. Larger values imply greater densities
      toward the base of the canopy.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_RADIATION::l_embedded_snow` = TRUE.


   .. nml:member:: lai_alb_lim_sn

      :type: real(npft)
      :default: MDI

      Minimum LAI in calculation of albedo in the presence of snow.

      A minimum albedo is imposed when calculating the albedo of
      plant canopies (historically 0.5). This parameter allows it
      to be set for each PFT in the presence of snow. A separate variable,
      :nml:mem:`JULES_PFTPARM::lai_alb_lim_io` is used in the absence of snow.


.. nml:group:: Other snow parameters
   
   .. nml:member:: rho_snow_const

      :type: real
      :default: 250.0

      Constant density of lying snow (kg m\ :sup:`-3`).

      This value is used if :nml:mem:`nsmax` = 0, in which case all
      snow is modelled as a single layer of constant density. If
      :nml:mem:`nsmax` > 0, snow density is prognostic.



   .. nml:member:: rho_snow_fresh

      :type: real
      :default: 100.0

      Density of fresh snow (kg m\ :sup:`-3`).

      This value is only used if :nml:mem:`nsmax` > 0.

   .. nml:member:: rho_firn_albedo

      :type: real
      :default: 550.0

      If :nml:mem:`JULES_SURFACE::l_elev_land_ice` = TRUE, this is the threshold density (as measured over the ~top 10cm, depending
      on how the dzsnow layers are specified) at which the grain-size calculation of prognostic snow albedo will switch to one
      dependent on the surface density of the snowpack. Albedo is linearly scaled between `amax` for `rho_snow_const` and `aicemax` 
      for rho_ice=917 kg/m^3. 


   .. nml:member:: snow_hcon

      :type: real
      :default: 0.265

      Thermal conductivity of lying snow (W m\ :sup:`-1` K\ :sup:`-1`).

      See HCTN30 Eq.42.


   .. nml:member:: snow_hcap

      :type: real
      :default: 0.63e6

      Thermal capacity of lying snow (J K\ :sup:`-1` m\ :sup:`-3`).


   .. nml:member:: snowliqcap

      :type: real
      :default: 0.05

      Liquid water holding capacity of lying snow, as a fraction of snow mass.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`nsmax` > 0.


   .. nml:member:: snowinterceptfact

      :type: real
      :default: 0.7

      Constant in relationship between mass of intercepted snow and snowfall rate.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::can_model` = 4.


   .. nml:member:: snowloadlai

      :type: real
      :default: 4.4

      Ratio of maximum canopy snow load to leaf area index (kg m\ :sup:`-2`).

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::can_model` = 4.


   .. nml:member:: snowunloadfact

      :type: real
      :default: 0.4

      Constant in relationship between canopy snow unloading and canopy snow melt rate.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::can_model` = 4.


   .. nml:member:: unload_rate_cnst

      :type: real(npft)
      :default: MDI

      Constant term in the background unloading rate for snow on the canopy.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::can_model` = 4 and :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::cansnowpft` = TRUE on that tile.


   .. nml:member:: unload_rate_u

      :type: real(npft)
      :default: MDI

      Term proportional to wind speed in unloading rate for snow on the canopy.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::can_model` = 4 and :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::cansnowpft` = TRUE on that tile.


   .. nml:member:: i_snow_cond_parm

      :type: integer
      :permitted: 0 or 1
      :default: MDI

      Scheme used to calculate the conductivity of snow

      Two parametrizations of snow conductivity are available
      taken from the papers of :ref:`Yen (1981)<References_snow>` and
      :ref:`Calonne et al. (2011)<References_snow>`.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::nsmax` > 0.

   .. nml:member:: l_et_metamorph

      :type: logical
      :default: F

      TRUE
          Include the effect of thermal metamorphism on the snow density.

      FALSE
          No effect.

      This parametrization follows the form used by eg. Dutra et al. (2010)


   .. nml:member:: l_snow_infilt

      :type: logical
      :default: F

      TRUE
          Pass rainfall and melting from the canopy to the snowpack as infiltration.

      FALSE
          No effect.


   .. nml:member:: l_snow_nocan_hc

      :type: logical
      :default: F

      TRUE
          Do not include the canopy heat capacity in the surface energy balance at the top of the snow pack on tiles without a canopy snow model.

      FALSE
          The canopy heat capacity is include in the surface energy balance at the top of the snow pack.


   .. nml:member:: a_snow_et

      :type: real
      :default: MDI

      Constant in parametrization of thermal metamorphism.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::l_et_metamorph` = TRUE. 

   .. nml:member:: b_snow_et

      :type: real
      :default: MDI

      Constant in parametrization of thermal metamorphism.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::l_et_metamorph` = TRUE. 

   .. nml:member:: c_snow_et

      :type: real
      :default: MDI

      Constant in parametrization of thermal metamorphism.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::l_et_metamorph` = TRUE. 

   .. nml:member:: rho_snow_et_crit

      :type: real
      :default: MDI

      Critical density in parametrization of thermal metamorphism.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::l_et_metamorph` = TRUE. 


   .. nml:member:: i_grain_growth_opt

      :type: integer
      :permitted: 0 or 1
      :default: 0

      Scheme used to calculate the rate of growth of snow grains.

      Setting this to 0 invokes the original scheme based on Marshall (1989),
      with no dependence of the rate of growth of small grains on the
      temperature.

      Setting it to 1 invokes the scheme for growth of snow grains proposed
      by Taillandier et al. (2007) for equitemperature metamorphism. This
      is significantly slower than the default scheme at low temperatures.


   .. nml:member:: i_relayer_opt

      :type: integer
      :permitted: 0 or 1
      :default: 0

      Scheme used to relayer the snowpack. Setting the option to 0 invokes
      the original scheme with relayering of the grain size involving the
      grain size itself, while setting it to 1 causes the relayering to be 
      done using the inverse of the grain size. This is more consistent
      with conserving the SSA, though full conservation would require
      mass weighting to be invoked during regridding.

      Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::nsmax` > 0.

   .. nml:member:: i_basal_melting_opt

      :type: integer
      :permitted: 0 or 1
      :default: 0

      Option to treat basal melting of the snow pack. When snow falls
      on warm ground, it will melt from the base of the snowpack, 
      where the temperature of the snow will rise to the melting point.
      The 0-layer snow scheme, which is used for thin snow even when the
      multilayer scheme is selected, did not represent this process and
      included only melting at the surface. This option allows 
      basal melting to be omitted if it is set to the defaut value of 0, 
      but offers an alternative setting of 1, which results in basal 
      melting taking place instantaneously if the temperature of the
      first soil layer is above freezing, until the snow is removed or
      the temperature of soil layer is reduced to freezing.





Example of the evolution of snow layer thickness
------------------------------------------------

The table below gives an example of how the number and thickness of snow layers varies with total snow depth for the case of :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::nsmax` = 3 and ``dzsnow = (0.1, 0.15, 0.2)``. Note that if the values given by the user for :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::dzsnow` are a decreasing series with ``dzsnow(i) <= 2 * dzsnow(i - 1)``, the algorithm will result in layers ``i`` and ``i + 1`` being added at the same time. Don't panic - this should not be a problem for the simulation.
