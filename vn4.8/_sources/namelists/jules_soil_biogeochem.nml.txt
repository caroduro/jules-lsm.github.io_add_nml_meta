.. nml:namelist:: JULES_SOIL_BIOGEOCHEM


.. nml:member:: soil_bgc_model

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1 or 2
   :default: 1

   Choice for model of soil biogeochemistry.
   
   Possible values are:

   1. | A single-pool model of soil carbon turnover in which the pool is not prognostic (not updated).
      | This must be used when the TRIFFID vegetation model is not selected (:nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_triffid` = FALSE).

   2. | A 4-pool model of soil carbon and nitrogen, originally based on the RothC model.
      | This must be used when the TRIFFID vegetation model is selected (:nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_triffid` = TRUE).
      | Historically this was bundled with the TRIFFID vegetation model.

   .. note:: At present this variable is redundant because it can be inferred from :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_triffid`, but it was added to support future developments.


.. nml:member:: l_layeredc

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for using the layered soil carbon model, currently only relevant if TRIFFID is switched on (:nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_triffid` = TRUE). Using the approach of Burke et al.(2016). Two parameters can be defined for this model - :nml:mem:`tau_resp`, :nml:mem:`tau_lit`.

   Layered soil nitrogen is also available if the nitrogen cycle is switched on (:nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_nitrogen` = TRUE), but this is a highly experimental version which needs further evaluation and so should be used with extreme caution. One additional parameter is required for layered soil nitrogen - :nml:mem:`diff_n_pft`.

   TRUE
      The number and thickness of layers in the soil carbon model are set equal to those in the soil moisture model (:nml:lst:`JULES_SOIL`).

   FALSE
      There are no specific layers in the soil carbon model (a single, bulk pool).

.. nml:member:: l_q10

   :type: logical
   :default: T

   Switch for use of Q10 approach when calculating soil respiration.

   TRUE
       Use Q10 approach.

       .. note:: This is always enforced if TRIFFID is switched off (:nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_triffid` = FALSE) and was used in JULES2.0.

   FALSE
       Use the approach of the RothC model.


.. nml:member:: l_soil_resp_lev2

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch affecting the temperature and moisture used for soil respiration calculation.

   TRUE
       Temperature and total (frozen+unfrozen) moisture content of the second soil layer are used.

   FALSE
       Temperature and unfrozen moisture content of the first (topmost) soil layer are used.

       .. note:: If layered soil C is used (:nml:mem:`l_layeredc` = TRUE) the temperature and moisture of each soil layer is used to calculation respiration from that layer.


.. nml:member:: q10_soil

   :type: real
   :default: 2.0

   Q10 factor for soil respiration.

   Only used if :nml:mem:`l_q10` = TRUE.
   
   See `Hadley Centre Technical Note 24 <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/archive/hadley-centre-technical-note-24>`_ Eq.17.


.. nml:group:: Parameters for the single-pool model (only used if :nml:mem:`soil_bgc_model` = 1)
   
   .. nml:member:: kaps

      :type: real
      :default: 0.5e-8

      Specific soil respiration rate at 25 degC and optimum soil moisture (s\ :sup:`-1`).

      See `Hadley Centre Technical Note 24 <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/archive/hadley-centre-technical-note-24>`_ Eq.16.

.. nml:group:: Parameters for the RothC-based model (only used if :nml:mem:`soil_bgc_model` = 2)

   .. nml:member:: kaps_roth

      :type: real(4)
      :default: 3.22e-7, 9.65e-9, 2.12e-8, 6.43e-10

      Specific soil respiration rate for the RothC submodel for each soil carbon pool.
   
      Only used if using the RothC-based soil C model (:nml:mem:`soil_bgc_model` = 2), in which case soil carbon is modelled using four pools (biomass, humus, decomposable plant material, resistant plant material).


   .. nml:member:: bio_hum_cn

      :type: real
      :default: 10.0

      Parameter controlling ratio of C to N for BIO and HUM pools.


   .. nml:member:: sorp

      :type: real
      :default: 10.0

      Parameter controlling the leaching of inorganic N through the soil profile. A factor of 1 means that in a timestep all the inorganic N is available for leaching. The default value of 10 means that 10% of inorganic N is available for leaching.


   .. nml:member:: n_inorg_turnover

      :type: real
      :default: 1.0

      Parameter controlling the lifetime of the inorganic N pool. A value of 1 implies the whole pool will turnover in 360 days.


   .. nml:member:: tau_resp

      :type: real
      :default: 2.0

      Parameter controlling decay of respiration with depth (m-1). Only used with layered soil carbon (:nml:mem:`l_layeredc` = TRUE).


   .. nml:member:: tau_lit

      :type: real
      :default: 5.0

      Parameter controlling the decay of litter with depth (m-1). Only used with layered soil carbon (:nml:mem:`l_layeredc` = TRUE).


   .. nml:member:: diff_n_pft

      :type: real
      :default: 5.0

      Parameter controlling the rate of re-filling of the available inorganic nitrogen pool (1/360 days). This parameter determines how quickly the inorganic nitrogen reaches the roots after the roots uptake from the soil around them. This should be quicker than the turnover rate of inorganic nitrogen. In addition, it has to be small compared with the triffid timestep (360/triffid_period) otherwise the available inorganic nitrogen becomes unstable. Hence the choice of the default value 5. Only used with layered soil carbon and nitrogen scheme (:nml:mem:`l_layeredc` = TRUE and :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_nitrogen` = TRUE).
