The JULES namelist files
========================


Each run of JULES is controlled by a number of files containing Fortran namelists. These files specify details including:

* Switches to allow different model configurations to be selected at run-time.
* Start and end times for the run.
* What input data to use and how to read it.
* How to construct the model grid.
* Values for various parameters.
* The required output.

These files have specific names, and JULES expects all these files to exist for every run (even when their contents are not required). JULES also expects that the namelists within each file appear in the order given below.
