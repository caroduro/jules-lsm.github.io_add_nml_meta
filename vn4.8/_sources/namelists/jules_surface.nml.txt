=====================


This file sets the surface options. It contains one namelist called :nml:lst:`JULES_SURFACE`.



``JULES_SURFACE`` namelist members
----------------------------------

.. nml:namelist:: JULES_SURFACE

.. nml:member:: l_aggregate

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch controlling number of tiles for each gridbox.

   This is used to set the number of surface energy balances that are solved for each gridbox (``ntiles``).

   TRUE
       Aggregate parameter values are used to solve a single energy balance per gridbox. This option sets ``ntiles = 1``.

   FALSE
       A separate energy balance is calculated for each surface type. This option sets ``ntiles = ntype``.


.. nml:member:: i_aggregate_opt

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 0-1
   :default: 0

   Option for aggregating surface propeties to tiles:

   0. Aggregate momentum roughness lengths and set the thermal roughness length as a given fraction of this (in practice the ratio of roughness lengths for the first surafce type).
   1. Aggregate the thermal roughness lengths separately from the momentum roughness lengths using an analogous algorithm.

   .. note::
       This option is ignored unless :nml:mem:`l_aggregate` is true.


.. nml:member:: l_epot_corr

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   TRUE
       Use correction to the calculation of potential evaporation.

   FALSE
       No effect.


.. nml:member:: l_point_data

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Flag indicating if driving data are point or area-average values. This affects the treatment of precipitation input and how snow affects the albedo.

   TRUE
       Driving data are point data. Precipitation is not distributed in space (see FALSE below) and is all assumed to be large-scale in origin. The albedo formulation is suitable for a point.

   FALSE
       Driving data are area averages. The precipitation inputs are assumed to be exponentially distributed in space, as in UMDP25, and can include convective and large-scale components. The albedo formulation is suitable for a gridbox.
       
       
.. nml:member:: l_land_ice_imp

   :type: logical
   :default: F
   
   Switch to control the use of implicit numerics to update land ice temperatures.
   
   TRUE
       Use implicit numerics to update land ice temperatures.
       
   FALSE
       Use explicit numerics to update land ice temperatures.


.. nml:member:: l_anthrop_heat_src

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for inclusion of anthropogenic contribution to the surface heat flux from urban tiles.

   TRUE
       Add anthropogenic effect.

   FALSE
       No effect.


.. nml:member:: iscrntdiag

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 0 or 1
   :default: 0

   Switch controlling method for diagnosing screen temperature.

   0. Use surface similarity theory.
   1. Use surface similarity theory but allow decoupling in very stable conditions based on the quasi-equilibrium radiative solution.

.. nml:member:: l_elev_lw_down

      :type: logical
      :default: false

      If tiles are set to be at an elevation offset from the gridbox mean altitude (see :nml:lst:`JULES_SURF_HGT`) this switch controls
      whether downwelling longwave radiation is adjusted along with surface air temperature and relative humidity.

      If true, the downwelling longwave for each tile not at the gridbox mean height is adjusted by an amount 
      proportional to the fourth power of the adjustment that has been made to the surface air temperature. The adjustments are then
      scaled such that the sum over all tiles conserves the gridbox mean energy in the original forcing.

   
.. nml:member:: l_elev_land_ice

      :type: logical
      :default: false

      Allows multiple ice tiles to exist in an ice gridbox, usually with each representing a different elevation (:nml:lst:`JULES_SURF_HGT`)
      band on the ice so that a sub-gridscale surface mass balance term (a strong function of altitude) can be derived for forcing icesheet/glacier models. 
      When enabled, ice tiles in a gridbox do not use the usual (gridbox mean) JULES soil/ice subsurface model, but each tile has an independent
      single layer bedrock-type solid ice boundary condition under the snowpack.

      In addition, when selected, dense snowpacks on ice gridboxes are parameterised to behave more like firn in two ways. 
      1) The meltwater-holding capacity of snow layers reduces as a linear function of their density, becoming zero 
      above the pore-closure density of 850 kg/m^2 so as to restrict retention of melt within the snowpack. 
      2) Where the top few centimetres of the pack has a density appropriate to firn/bare ice
      and the grain-size physics otherwise used for snow albedo become less appropriate, 
      surface albedo becomes a function of density, tending towards that of bare ice as density increases 
      (see :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::rho_firn_albedo`, :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::amax`, :nml:mem:`JULES_SNOW::aicemax`).
      
      If this scheme is enabled, a depth for the bedrock layer must be provided (:nml:mem:`JULES_SOIL::dzsoil_elev`) and the new tile numbers
      must be specified (:nml:lst:`JULES_SURFACE_TYPES`) as type elev_ice. The total number of non-vegetated tiles, and their surface properties
      (:nml:lst:`JULES_NVEGPARM`, usually set to be the same as the normal ice tile) must be set accordingly, as with any tile.
