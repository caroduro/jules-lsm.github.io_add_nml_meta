``model_environment.nml``
=========================


This file sets the model environment options e.g. whether JULES is coupled to the UM or run in a standalone environment. It contains one namelist called :nml:lst:`JULES_MODEL_ENVIRONMENT`.

There are many JULES science options that are in shared namelists, so they can be read both by standalone and by a model driving JULES e.g. the UM. However some options either make no scientific sense or the necessary input data are not available to the environment in which JULES is being driven as the plumbing has not yet been done. This causes problems for example when creating standalone apps from UM configurations. This namelist allows the environment in which JULES is being run to be specified so that options that are unavailable can be made inaccessible via the metadata and thus will not appear in the gui. Warnings can also be issued if options are inappropriately set.

``JULES_MODEL_ENVIRONMENT`` namelist members
--------------------------------------------

.. nml:namelist:: JULES_MODEL_ENVIRONMENT

.. nml:member:: l_jules_parent

   :type: integer
   :default: imdi

   Switch to identify the environment in which JULES is being run. The switch should only be used to allow science options, which are not available in the specified model environment, to be trigger ignored and checked that they are set appropriately at run-time.

   .. warning::
      No science code should be associated with this switch, only what science options are available.

   0
       JULES is being run standalone. Any options that are only available to the parent model (e.g. the UM) will be trigger ignored.

   1
       JULES is being run coupled to the UM. Options not available to the UM are trigger-ignored.

   .. note::
      The metadata only actually allows option 0 (i.e. standalone) to be selected. Any other parent models are listed here for your information only. It is not appropriate to include a list of the unavailable options here. However, information for namelists that have been consolidated will appear in the following checking routines as they are completed.
