``science_fixes.nml``
=====================


This file contains one namelist called :nml:lst:`JULES_TEMP_FIXES`.

This namelist sets 'short-term' temporary logicals used to protect science bug
fixes that lead to alterations in science results. It is expected that these
logicals will be short lived as the preference should be for all configurations
to use the corrected code. However, to maintain short term reproducibility of
results across JULES versions the fixes are protected by logicals until the
fixes become the default in all model configurations at which point the logical
is retired. See module for when the switch is due for review.

``JULES_TEMP_FIXES`` namelist members
-------------------------------------

.. nml:namelist:: JULES_TEMP_FIXES

.. nml:member:: l_fix_moruses_roof_rad_coupling

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   This switch corrects a bug in the surface energy balance when the MORUSES
   radiative roof coupling is used
   (see :nml:mem:`JULES_URBAN_SWITCHES::l_moruses_storage`). The thermal
   conductivity of the soil (hcons) is erroneously set to zero, which causes
   the roof to be effectively uncoupled when
   :nml:mem:`JULES_VEGETATION::l_vegcan_soilfx`.
